# GitHub Authentication Setup

This skill sets up authentication so the agent can work with GitHub repositories, PRs, issues, and CI. It covers two paths:

- **`git` (always available)** — uses HTTPS personal access tokens or SSH keys
- **`gh` CLI (if installed)** — richer GitHub API access with a simpler auth flow

## Detection Flow

When a user asks you to work with GitHub, run this check first:

```bash
# Check what's available
git --version
gh --version 2>/dev/null || echo "gh not installed"

# Check if already authenticated
gh auth status 2>/dev/null || echo "gh not authenticated"
git config --global credential.helper 2>/dev/null || echo "no git credential helper"
```

**Decision tree:**
1. If `gh auth status` shows authenticated → you're good, use `gh` for everything
2. If `gh` is installed but not authenticated → use "gh auth" method below
3. If `gh` is not installed → use "git-only" method below (no sudo needed)

---

## Method 1: Git-Only Authentication (No gh, No sudo)

This works on any machine with `git` installed. No root access needed.

### Option A: HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Recommended)

This is the most portable method — works everywhere, no SSH config needed.

**Step 1: Create a personal access token**

Tell the user to go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens**

- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give it a name like "hermes-agent"
- Select scopes:
  - `repo` (full repository access — read, write, push, PRs)
  - `workflow` (trigger and manage GitHub Actions)
  - `read:org` (if working with organization repos)
- Set expiration (90 days is a good default)
- Copy the token — it won't be shown again

**Step 2: Configure git to store the token**

```bash
# Set up the credential helper to cache credentials
# "store" saves to ~/.git-credentials in plaintext (simple, persistent)
git config --global credential.helper store

# Now do a test operation that triggers auth — git will prompt for credentials
# Username: <their-github-username>
# Password: <paste the personal access token, NOT their GitHub password>
git ls-remote https://github.com/<their-username>/<any-repo>.git
```

After entering credentials once, they're saved and reused for all future operations.

**Alternative: cache helper (credentials expire from memory)**

```bash
# Cache in memory for 8 hours (28800 seconds) instead of saving to disk
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=28800'
```

**Alternative: set the token directly in the remote URL (per-repo)**

```bash
# Embed token in the remote URL (avoids credential prompts entirely)
git remote set-url origin https://<username>:<token>@github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
```

**Step 3: Configure git identity**

```bash
# Required for commits — set name and email
git config --global user.name "Their Name"
git config --global user.email "their-email@example.com"
```

**Step 4: Verify**

```bash
# Test push access (this should work without any prompts now)
git ls-remote https://github.com/<their-username>/<any-repo>.git

# Verify identity
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

### Option B: SSH Key Authentication

Good for users who prefer SSH or already have keys set up.

**Step 1: Check for existing SSH keys**

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh/id_*.pub 2>/dev/null || echo "No SSH keys found"
```

**Step 2: Generate a key if needed**

```bash
# Generate an ed25519 key (modern, secure, fast)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "their-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""

# Display the public key for them to add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Tell the user to add the public key at: **https://github.com/settings/keys**
- Click "New SSH key"
- Paste the public key content
- Give it a title like "hermes-agent-<machine-name>"

**Step 3: Test the connection**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# Expected: "Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated..."
```

**Step 4: Configure git to use SSH for GitHub**

```bash
# Rewrite HTTPS GitHub URLs to SSH automatically
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

**Step 5: Configure git identity**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Their Name"
git config --global user.email "their-email@example.com"
```

## Method 2: gh CLI Authentication

If `gh` is installed, it handles both API access and git credentials in one step.

### Interactive Browser Login (Desktop)

> **PITFALL (agent-driven sessions on Windows):** when driving `gh auth login` through a pty background process, answer prompts with `process(submit)` — never `process(write)` with a bare `\n`. Enter on a Windows PTY (ConPTY/pywinpty) is a carriage return; a lone `\n` is not delivered as a line terminator, so gh's "Press Enter to open the browser" prompt (a blocking line read) silently never returns and the login hangs. Also note the browser may not open on the user's desktop from a background session — if they report that, fall back to the device flow below.

```bash
gh auth login
# Select: GitHub.com
# Select: HTTPS
# Authenticate via browser
```

### Manual OAuth Device Flow (no TTY needed — PROVEN)

Fallback when interactive login is impractical (agent-driven sessions, no browser launch, headless). Uses gh's public OAuth client id; the user just enters a code at github.com/login/device. Scopes: `repo,read:org,gist` is the documented minimum for `gh auth login --with-token`; append `,workflow` only if you need to push workflow files.

```bash
# 1. Request a device code (gh's official client_id)
RESP=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d "client_id=178c6fc778ccc68e1d6a&scope=repo,read:org,gist" \
  https://github.com/login/device/code)
DEVICE_CODE=$(echo "$RESP" | sed 's/.*"device_code":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/')
USER_CODE=$(echo "$RESP" | sed 's/.*"user_code":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/')
INTERVAL=$(echo "$RESP" | sed 's/.*"interval":\([0-9]*\).*/\1/'); INTERVAL=${INTERVAL:-5}
echo "Tell the user: go to https://github.com/login/device and enter code: $USER_CODE"

# 2. Poll for the token (respect interval; +5s on slow_down; ~15 min expiry).
#    Run this loop as a background process and show the user the code first.
while true; do
  sleep "$INTERVAL"
  POLL=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -d "client_id=178c6fc778ccc68e1d6a&device_code=${DEVICE_CODE}&grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code" \
    https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token)
  case "$POLL" in
    *access_token*)
      # Never echo the token; pipe it straight into gh.
      # timeout guards the headless-keyring hang (see pitfall below) —
      # on exit 124, fall back to writing ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml directly.
      echo "$POLL" | sed 's/.*"access_token":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/' | timeout 20 gh auth login --with-token \
        || { echo "WITH_TOKEN_HUNG_OR_FAILED — use the hosts.yml fallback below"; exit 1; }
      gh auth setup-git
      gh auth status
      echo "LOGIN_COMPLETE"; break ;;
    *authorization_pending*) ;;                      # keep polling
    *slow_down*) INTERVAL=$((INTERVAL + 5)) ;;       # back off per GitHub docs
    *expired_token*) echo "CODE_EXPIRED — restart the flow"; exit 1 ;;
    *access_denied*) echo "USER_DENIED"; exit 1 ;;
    *) echo "UNEXPECTED: $POLL"; exit 1 ;;
  esac
done
```

Note: on Windows winget installs, gh lands at `/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI` — add it to PATH in the same shell: `export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI"`.

### Token-Based Login (Headless / SSH Servers)

```bash
echo "<THEIR_TOKEN>" | gh auth login --with-token

# Set up git credentials through gh
gh auth setup-git
```

If `--with-token` hangs here, use the hosts.yml fallback from the pitfall above.

> **PITFALL (fine-grained PATs vs `gh auth login --with-token`).** gh's `--with-token` runs the **classic-scope** validator on every token it accepts. A fine-grained PAT (https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) doesn't carry `read:org` — that scope only exists on classic PATs — so gh rejects it with `error validating token: missing required scope 'read:org'` even when the token is otherwise valid. gh's own help text names the fix: **set `GH_TOKEN=<token>` in the environment instead of using `--with-token`.** Fine-grained PATs are intentionally designed for env-var use; gh detects the env var and skips the classic-scope check.
>
> Concretely, the working headless flow is:
>
> ```bash
> export GH_TOKEN='<fine-grained-PAT>'
> gh auth status            # shows ✓ Logged in ... (GH_TOKEN)
> gh auth setup-git         # registers the credential helper
> ```
>
> Two gotchas with this flow:
> - **The token is not persisted.** Fine-grained PATs cannot be written into `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` via `gh auth login --with-token` (same classic-scope gate), so each new shell must re-export `GH_TOKEN`, or add `export GH_TOKEN=...` to `~/.zshrc`.
> - **`gh auth login --with-token` refuses while `GH_TOKEN` is set.** Output: `The value of the GH_TOKEN environment variable is being used for authentication. To have GitHub CLI store credentials instead, first clear the value from the environment.` Unset first if you actually want to persist.
> - **`gh auth status` warns `Missing required token scopes: 'read:org'`** even when the env-var flow works. That's a noise warning, not a real failure — fine-grained PATs cannot carry that scope. Cross-check with `gh api user --jq .login`; if it returns a username, you're authenticated for everything the fine-grained token's actual permissions cover.

> **PITFALL (`gh auth login --web` device codes expire in ~30 seconds in agent-driven sessions.)** When you launch `gh auth login --web --git-protocol https --hostname github.com` from a background/PTY process, gh (a) prints a one-time device code and tells you to "Press Enter to open https://github.com/login/device in your browser", then (b) **polls GitHub's device-code endpoint until either the user authorizes or the code expires — default ~30 seconds**. Two failure modes surface immediately:
> - **You can't open the browser for the user.** gh's `open` runs in its own PTY context, not the user's desktop; on macOS it may pop a Terminal window the user wasn't expecting, or fail silently. Don't rely on gh to open the browser — tell the user the code and the URL yourself and let them open it.
> - **The code expires while you're talking to the user.** If the chat round-trip takes more than ~30s, the next poll returns `This 'device_code' has expired. (expired_token)` and the whole process exits 1.
>
> If `--web` is the only path available (e.g., the user can't or won't paste a PAT), the manual OAuth device flow above (the `curl` + poll loop) is more reliable — same GitHub endpoint, but you control the polling interval and surface the code to the user immediately, before the first poll runs.

### Verify

```bash
gh auth status
```

## Using the GitHub API Without gh

When `gh` is not available, you can still access the full GitHub API using `curl` with a personal access token. This is how the other GitHub skills implement their fallbacks.

### Setting the Token for API Calls

```bash
# Option 1: Export as env var (preferred — keeps it out of commands)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<token>"

# Then use in curl calls:
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/user
```

### Extracting the Token from Git Credentials

If git credentials are already configured (via credential.helper store), the token can be extracted:

```bash
# Read from git credential store
uv run python "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/github/github-auth/scripts/git-credential-token.py"
```

### Helper: Detect Auth Method

Use this pattern at the start of any GitHub workflow:

```bash
# Try gh first, fall back to git + curl
if command -v gh &>/dev/null && gh auth status &>/dev/null; then
  echo "AUTH_METHOD=gh"
elif [ -n "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "AUTH_METHOD=curl"
elif _hermes_env="${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/.env"; [ -f "$_hermes_env" ] && grep -q "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" "$_hermes_env"; then
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" "$_hermes_env" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '\n\r')
  echo "AUTH_METHOD=curl"
elif grep -q "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null; then
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(uv run python "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/github/github-auth/scripts/git-credential-token.py")
  echo "AUTH_METHOD=curl"
else
  echo "AUTH_METHOD=none"
  echo "Need to set up authentication first"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `git push` asks for password | GitHub disabled password auth. Use a personal access token as the password, or switch to SSH |
| `remote: Permission to X denied` | Token may lack `repo` scope — regenerate with correct scopes |
| `fatal: Authentication failed` | Cached credentials may be stale — run `git credential reject` then re-authenticate |
| `ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection refused` | Try SSH over HTTPS port: add `Host github.com` with `Port 443` and `Hostname ssh.github.com` to `~/.ssh/config` |
| Credentials not persisting | Check `git config --global credential.helper` — must be `store` or `cache` |
| Multiple GitHub accounts | Use SSH with different keys per host alias in `~/.ssh/config`, or per-repo credential URLs |
| `gh: command not found` + no sudo | Use git-only Method 1 above — no installation needed |
| Branch pushed but no `gh` and no token to create PR | Push the branch with `git push -u origin HEAD`, then open `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<base>...<branch>?expand=1` in the user's browser; tell them to sign in if not already, then click "Create pull request". SSH keys authenticate `git push` but cannot authorize GitHub's REST API — only HTTPS personal access tokens or the `gh` CLI can POST to `/repos/.../pulls`.
