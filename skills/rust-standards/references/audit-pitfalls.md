# Audit script false-positive catalog

`scripts/audit_rust_standards.py` checks 20 categories of rust-standards
violations in a single pass. Several categories cannot be checked
statically because the master repo has pattern exceptions that look like
violations to a non-master-aware script. This document enumerates every
known false positive so the next session doesn't waste time chasing them.

## 0. A companion verifier that does not exist used to look like a PASS

`run_check` counts stdout lines as hits, so a verifier that produced NO stdout
could mean "scanned everything, found nothing" **or** "the script is missing and
python3 printed to stderr and exited 2". Five checks were in the second state
for the whole life of the audit: `verify_ci_no_bump`, `verify_no_impl_trait_params`,
`verify_module_imports_centralized`, `verify_lib_rs_order`, `verify_no_test_comments`.
They were never written; the audit referenced them anyway. All five now exist
with fixtures and mutation-tested self-tests, and `run_check` reports a missing
companion as an explicit FAIL.

A missing file, a crashed verifier, and a clean pass are three different
outcomes. When you add a check, run its self-test before trusting a green audit.

## 0b. Two real bugs a fixture alone would never have found

Both were found only by running the verifiers against euv / hyperlane / ctares,
because a hand-written fixture is too small to reach the edge:

- **`_skip_whole_block` can return `len(lines)`.** A file ending in an unclosed
  `fn` (a macro fragment, a truncated file) made the signature scan index past
  the end and crash with `IndexError`. Every fixture had balanced braces.
- **A `Path` variable holding a directory is silently unreadable.** Assigning
  `manifest = parent` instead of `manifest = parent / "Cargo.toml"` then calling
  `.read_text()` raises `IsADirectoryError`, which `except OSError` swallowed —
  so every crate looked dependency-free and every §6.1 group-2/group-3
  distinction collapsed to "local". Errors on the manifest path are now printed
  to stderr instead of being swallowed.

**A verifier that has never run on a real codebase is not a verifier.** After
adding fixtures, run each script against at least one real workspace and read
the findings — 688 "violations" on euv were 5 real ones plus 683 false positives
from the two bugs above.

## 1. `mod r#<keyword>;` in any mod.rs — NOT a violation

`mod r#struct;`, `mod r#impl;`, `mod r#fn;`, `mod r#enum;`, `mod
r#const;`, `mod r#static;`, `mod r#type;`, `mod r#trait;` are all
**required** by master pattern (R6.2). The `r#` prefix is needed
because `struct`/`impl`/`fn`/etc. are Rust keywords. The audit script's
"r# on non-keyword file" check excludes these 9 names — if you see other
files with `r#`, that's a real violation.

## 2. `mod r#<sub>;` inside `core/src/tests/mod.rs` — NOT a violation

Per R14.1a, the test mod.rs uses `mod r#<sub>;` (with `r#`) for every
sub-test, even when `<sub>` is not a keyword (e.g. `mod r#signal;`,
`mod r#cache;`). This is the explicit exception in R14.1a and the
audit script skips `core/src/tests/mod.rs` and `cli/tests/mod.rs`
entirely. Audit category 11 (r# on non-keyword file) already skips
files in `/tests/` subdirs.

## 3. `pub use super::*;` (with `pub`) as last line of
   `core/src/tests/<sub>/mod.rs` — NOT a violation

Per R14.1a, test mod.rs files in `core/src/tests/<sub>/` use `pub use
super::*;` (with `pub`) as their last non-blank line. This is required
so the tests can access parent-module symbols via `use super::*;` in
`fn.rs`. The audit script's category 6 (mod.rs trailing `use
super::*`) accepts both `use super::*;` AND `pub use super::*;` as
valid endings, so this should not appear as a failure.

## 4. `use super::*;` (no `pub`) as last line of `core/tests/<sub>/mod.rs` — NOT a violation

Per R14.1b, integration test mod.rs files in `core/tests/<sub>/` use
`use super::*;` (no `pub`) as the last line. The `pub` would trigger
"no imported item is public enough" warnings because integration tests
are a separate compile crate. Master pattern: every line in
`core/tests/<sub>/mod.rs` ends with `use super::*;` without `pub`.

## 5. Direct `///` doc comment on `enum.rs` / `struct.rs` / `type.rs`
   without `use super::*;` first — NOT a violation

Master pattern allows `enum.rs` / `struct.rs` / `type.rs` to open with
a `///` doc comment if the type does not need to reference any symbol
from the parent module. Example:

```rust
/// The phase of a `SuspenseState`.
///
/// - `Pending` — the underlying data is still loading.
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub enum SuspensePhase { ... }
```

The audit script's category 7 (sub-file first line) reports these as
"violations" because the first non-comment line is `#[derive(...)]`,
not `use super::*;`. Manually confirm the file doesn't reference any
parent-module symbol via the `use super::*;` chain before fixing.

## 6. `//!` module-level doc comment as first line — NOT a violation

Module-level `//!` doc comments are allowed on **any** sub-file as the
first lines. The audit script's category 7 reports these as
"violations" because the first non-comment line is past the doc block
and may not be `use super::*;`. The script tries to handle this by
looking at the first non-blank, non-comment line — if your file opens
with `//!` and then has a `use super::*;` after a blank line, it is
correct.

## 7. `//` comment explaining "intentionally NOT imported super::*" — NOT a violation

Some files like `core/src/reactive/use_async/struct.rs` deliberately
skip `use super::*;` because the module defines its own trait and uses
fully-qualified `core::...` paths. The file opens with a `//` comment
explaining this. Audit script category 7 reports it; manually verify
the comment before fixing.

## 7a. Direct `///` doc comment on `const.rs` / `static.rs` / `fn.rs`
    / `trait.rs` / `impl.rs` without `use super::*;` first — NOT a
    violation

Master pattern treats every keyword-only sub-file the same way
`audit-pitfalls #5` already covers `enum.rs` / `struct.rs` /
`type.rs`: when the file defines only items in its dedicated keyword
(constants / statics / fns / traits / impls) and does not need any
parent-module symbol, it may open with a `///` doc comment directly.
A repo-wide grep for the first non-comment line across
`example/src/**/const.rs` returns 26 files in master, none of which
start with `use super::*;` — confirming the pattern is universal.

The audit script category 7 used to misreport these. As of
2026-08-28 it now matches by `basename` and skips every
keyword-only sub-file (`const.rs` / `static.rs` / `fn.rs` /
`enum.rs` / `struct.rs` / `trait.rs` / `impl.rs` / `type.rs`).
When in doubt, manually confirm the file doesn't reference any
parent-module symbol via the `use super::*;` chain before fixing.

## 7b. `mod r#async;` / `mod r#await;` / `mod r#try;` / `mod r#dyn;`
    in any mod.rs — NOT a violation

Per audit-pitfalls #1, `mod r#<keyword>;` is required whenever the
module path collides with a Rust keyword. The original exemption
list covered the nine traditional keywords (`const`, `static`, `fn`,
`enum`, `struct`, `trait`, `impl`, `type`, `mod`) but missed the
four keywords added by RFC 2018 (`async`, `await`, `try`) and the
2018 keyword-softening pass (`dyn`). Master accepts `mod r#async;`
in `example/src/page/mod.rs` and other pages whose module path
matches an RFC 2018 keyword. Audit script category 11 now matches
the full keyword list; if you see `mod r#<reserved>;` and the
identifier is a Rust keyword, the report is stale and should be
ignored.

## 8. `try_get_child_node` (or any helper that "should be removed") — VERIFY before deletion

The R6.4 audit table says helpers only used by ONE caller should be
inlined. But if the helper has been kept across many versions and the
calling site is the sole user, the deletion is safe. Grep the entire
crate (not just production) for the helper name before deleting:
`git grep -n "helper_name" $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`.

## 9. `#[allow(static_mut_refs)]` on a single line — likely intentional

If you see one `#[allow(static_mut_refs)]` on a `registry` / `get_mut_*`
function, it's the standard pattern for accessing `static mut` WASM
globals — don't strip these in a style audit pass. They are explicit,
single-line, and each gates a specific `unsafe { &mut *GLOBAL }`
access.

## 10. `panic!` inside `core/src/reactive/<feature>/tests/*.rs` or
   `core/src/tests/<sub>/fn.rs` — INTENTIONAL

Tests use `panic!()` / `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` directly per R11.4
exception. Audit script category 3 (production unwrap/expect/panic)
already excludes `tests/` paths; if you see a panic in the audit output
that's in a `tests/` file, the audit script has a bug — re-grep with
`grep -v "/tests/"` and verify.

## 11. `tag.get_name().as_str()` after `Tag::Element(Cow<'static, str>)` refactor

The `as_str()` method on `&str` is unstable in newer Rust toolchains
when called through auto-deref on `Cow<'_, str>` (Rust 2024 E0658
`str_as_str`). Use `.as_ref()` (returns `&str` via `AsRef<str>` impl)
or `&**name` (explicit deref) instead. Same pattern for
`HashMap<&str, ...>` keys produced from `attr.get_name().as_str()`
inside `patch_attributes` — needs `.as_ref()`.

## 12. macro emit `Tag::Element("div".to_string())` → `Cow::Borrowed("div")`

When refactoring `Tag::Element(String)` to `Tag::Element(Cow<'static,
str>)`, the macro `tag_literal = "#tag_name.to_string()"` token
**does not work** when wrapped in `Cow::Borrowed(...)` because
`"div".to_string()` is not `'static`. Use the raw string literal token
directly: `tag_literal = #tag_name` (no `.to_string()`) → wrap in
`Cow::Borrowed(#tag_literal)` at the call site.

## 13. `String::from(literal_string)` inside `html!` macro for portal target

Portal macro emits `String::from(#expr)` to support both string
literals (which become owned Strings) and `Signal<String>::get()`
values. After the `Cow` refactor, wrap the whole expression in
`Cow::Owned(String::from(#expr))` instead of `Cow::Borrowed(...)` —
portals accept runtime selectors, not just literals.

## 14. Duplicate `use super::*;` from prior migration

When migrating from a file with leading `//!` doc comment to the
R14.1 pattern (which requires `use super::*;` as first line), a
mechanical prepend of `use super::*;\n\n` to the original content
sometimes leaves the old `//!` block followed by ANOTHER
`use super::*;`. Always check: if a file has TWO consecutive
`use super::*;` lines, the first one is from the bad migration and
should be removed (the original `//!` block is also deleted in the
correct migration).

## 15. `match cache_ref.queue_microtask.as_ref() { Some(...) => ..., None => return false }`

After caching `queueMicrotask` as `Option<Function>`, the "checked
once, used many times" pattern is:

```rust
let fn = match cache_opt {
    Some(f) => f,
    None => return false,
};
```

NOT `.unwrap()`. The early-return-on-None makes the unwrap "safe" but
the audit rejects it. Use `match` or `if let Some(_) = ... else
{ return; }`.

## 16. Cargo.toml workspace deps come FIRST

Master convention for `[dependencies]` ordering: workspace-internal
deps first (e.g. `euv-core`, `euv-macros` for `Cargo.toml`; `euv`,
`euv-engine`, `euv-ui` for `example/Cargo.toml`), then externals in
length-ordered alphabetical order (shorter strings first). `core/Cargo.toml`
has no workspace deps, so the externals start with `js-sys`.

Blank lines between sections:
- After `[package]` block
- Between `[dependencies]` and `[dev-dependencies]`
- Between `[dev-dependencies]` and `[build-dependencies]` (if any)
- Between `[build-dependencies]` and `[lib]` (if any)
- No blank line AFTER the last block (no trailing newline-of-blank-line)

## 17. lib.rs `//!` doc comment IS allowed [DEPRECATED 2026-09-26 fifth iteration]

The audit script category 5 (// comments in mod.rs) does NOT
flag lib.rs. Master explicitly allows a top-of-file `//!` crate
description on lib.rs. Same for raw_html.rs (the only non-lib.rs file
allowed to have `//!` as first lines — it's the proc-macro implementation
file in `macros/src/`).

**[DEPRECATED 2026-09-26 fifth iteration]**:  This exemption is upgraded
to a MANDATORY rule by `verify_lib_rs_doc_comment.py` (audit check 37).
Per user original (2026-09-26 第五轮): "对于 lib.rs 必须要检查是否存在
//! 注释,注释第一行 //! 后是包名后面是一行 //! 再后面才是内容".
The required structure is now:

  //! <package_name>     // text must equal [package].name from Cargo.toml
  //!
  //! <description>      // project description

Real-workspace findings (euv): 5 lib.rs files violate this rule:
- `core/src/lib.rs:1` 写 `//! euv` 但 `[package].name = "euv-core"`
- `example/src/lib.rs:1` 写 `//! euv Example` 但 `name = "euv-example"`
- `docs/src/lib.rs:1` 完全没 `//!` 块
- `cli/src/lib.rs:1` 写 `//! euv CLI` 但 `name = "euv-cli"`
- `macros/src/lib.rs:1` 写 `//! euv_macros` 但 `name = "euv-macros"`

The historical "allowed" framing here is now reversed: missing the
`//!` block is a violation; the only "allowed" form is the canonical
3-line structure documented above.
## 18. `struct`/`fn` at column 0 inside WGSL shader raw strings — NOT a violation

Keyword-file purity scans (R1.3) that match top-level items by "line starts
at column 0" false-positive on `example/src/page/game_2d/hook/const.rs` and
`game_3d/hook/const.rs`: the WGSL shader source inside
`pub(crate) const GAME_*_WEBGPU_SHADER: &str = r#"..."#;` contains
`struct BallData {`, `fn vs_main(...)` etc. at column 0. These are shader
code, not Rust items. Any purity scanner must strip `r#"..."#` (and
`r##"..."##`) raw-string contents before matching col-0 item keywords, and
any block extractor must skip raw strings when brace-matching (a `}` inside
a shader string corrupts the depth counter and truncates the extracted
block).

## 19. test-file `use std::panic::{AssertUnwindSafe, catch_unwind};` — NOT a hoist target

The "dependency imports go to lib.rs" rule (R6.1) does NOT apply inside
`#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` blocks. The lib crate compiles in two passes
(`cargo check --lib` ignores `#[cfg(test)]` items, `cargo check --tests`
includes them); the top-level `use std::panic::{...};` in `core/src/lib.rs`
IS visible to `cargo check --lib`, but the TEST-side uses of
`catch_unwind` / `AssertUnwindSafe` live in `core/src/tests/<sub>/fn.rs`
where the lib's `use` line is NOT propagated because the tests/<sub>/fn.rs
is part of the `tests` module (inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in lib.rs),
not the lib crate's compile unit.

**Consequence**: `cargo check --lib` will see the panic imports as
unused (warning), but `cargo check --tests` needs them. The cleanest
fix is to keep `use std::panic::{AssertUnwindSafe, catch_unwind};`
INSIDE the test file (`core/src/tests/<sub>/fn.rs`) and let the lib's
own copy live or die based on actual production usage.

**Detection**: after running hoist_uses, any test file under
`core/src/tests/*/fn.rs` that references `AssertUnwindSafe` or
`catch_unwind` must keep its `use std::panic::{...};` import —
the audit script should skip `tests/` paths.

## 20. `self.field` direct access in owned-self consumers — NOT a violation

When an `impl` block owns `self` (`fn into_inner(self) -> T`, `impl Default`,
`fn new(...) -> Self`, or destructors like `Drop`) and needs the **owned**
value of a field, the lombok-generated `get_field(&self)` returns `&Field`
which is unusable: a generic `T: ?Sized` cannot be `Clone`d, and an
`unsafe { ptr::read(&self.field) }` would defeat the safety guarantee
that the struct's field-visibility rule (§6.4.1) was set up to provide.

**Permitted direct-field access sites** (no `#[allow]`, no `pub` bump):
- `fn into_inner(self) -> T { self.inner }` — adapter consumes self
  (e.g. `EventAdapter<F>::into_inner`, `AttrValueAdapter<T>::into_inner`,
  `InnerHtmlAdapter<T>::into_inner` in `core/vdom/cast/impl.rs`).
- `impl Default for X { fn default() -> Self { Self { field: ... } } }`
  — struct-literal init.
- `fn new(...) -> Self { Self { field } }` — constructor body.

**Why this is NOT a violation of "use the macro-generated accessor"**:
the lombok `get_field()` and a field-access inside a consumer are NOT
functionally equivalent (`&T` vs `T`); the macro is not an alternative
here. The hand-written `into_inner` IS the only Rust-idiomatic way to
move out of `self`.

**Companion rule**: `EngineCell` / `MaybeEngineCell` in
`engine/src/cell/struct.rs` carry a `T: ?Sized` bound that prevents
`#[derive(Data)]` (lombok requires `Sized`); they hand-write
`get_inner` / `set_inner` accessors explicitly noted in the struct doc
as "Lombok-shaped counterparts". The body of those hand-written accessors
uses `&self.inner` / `&mut self.inner` — this is also a §20-style
exception (the hand-written accessor IS the lombok contract for this
type). External call sites should still use `self.get_inner()` /
`self.set_inner(val)`.

**Detection**: an audit script can whitelist these sites by checking
the enclosing function is one of:
  - `fn into_inner(self) -> T`,
  - `impl Default for X { fn default() -> Self }`,
  - `fn new(...) -> Self { Self { ... } }`,
  - `impl Drop for X { fn drop(&mut self) }`,
  - or any function whose body is a hand-written `get_*` / `set_*`
    accessor for a `T: ?Sized` type.
Everything else should use `get_field` / `get_mut_field` / `set_field`.



## 21. `use super::*;` omission for leaf sub-files (clarification of §6.3)

`rust-standards/references/06-module-imports.md` §6.3 says sub-files "must"
have `use super::*;` as their first line, with the explicit exemption
for `const.rs` (which usually doesn't reference parent symbols). This
section extends the exemption: **any sub-file whose body does not
reference any parent-module identifier may omit `use super::*;`**.

**Why**: `use super::*;` triggers Rust's `unused_imports` lint when
the sub-file body genuinely has nothing to import from the parent.
Adding `#[allow(unused_imports)]` is forbidden by the warning-handling
principle (it would mask real dead imports later), and removing the
`use` would force every leaf enum/struct/type to add a comment
explaining "this file has no parent imports" — pure noise.

**Detection**: an audit script must NOT count a missing `use super::*;`
as a violation if the sub-file body, after stripping its own top-level
declarations and standard prelude types, has zero remaining identifier
references that could plausibly come from the parent module.

**Examples of sub-files legitimately exempt**:
- `enum.rs` that only defines `pub enum FooBar { ... }` with no
  body that references any sibling struct / type / fn.
- `type.rs` that only defines a single type alias.
- `fn.rs` that only defines a single free `pub fn name(...)` with
  no parent-module references.
- `trait.rs` that only defines a single trait with method bodies
  using only primitive types.

**NOT exempt** (still need `use super::*;`):
- `impl.rs` (impl bodies almost always reference sibling types).
- `fn.rs` with multiple free functions that cross-reference each other.
- Any sub-file where the body references a symbol declared in a
  sibling sub-file or the parent mod.rs.

The companion rule §6.3 still applies to non-leaf sub-files.
## 22. bulk rewriter applying R17.3 — must skip hand-written accessor bodies

When a rewriter script tries to enforce "every `self.field` becomes
`self.get_field()`" across the whole crate, it will blindly replace
`&self.inner` (inside the body of a hand-written `pub fn get_inner(&self)`
for a `T: ?Sized` type like `EngineCell`) with `self.get_inner()` — which
recurses infinitely.

**Pattern that triggers the bug** (seen in `engine/src/cell/impl.rs`):

```rust
impl<T: ?Sized> EngineCell<T> {
    pub fn get_inner(&self) -> &UnsafeCell<T> {
        &self.inner          // ← rewriter changes to `self.get_inner()` → recursion
    }
}
```

**Root cause**: a generic `T: ?Sized` type can't `#[derive(Data)]`, so
the project hand-writes `get_inner` / `set_inner` accessors that satisfy
the same Lombok contract. The rewriter can't tell the difference between
"external call site needing the macro accessor" and "hand-written
accessor body that has to use the field directly".

**Fix in the rewriter**: skip impl blocks where the target struct has
a hand-written `pub fn get_<field>(&self)` or `pub fn <field>(&self)`
*and* the body of the rewrite site is *inside* one of those functions.
Equivalently, identify "hand-written Lombok-shaped accessors" by the
presence of a `// Lombok-shaped counterpart for parity with ...` doc
comment (see `engine/src/cell/struct.rs` for the project's
convention).

**Detection after running the rewriter**: `cargo check` will report
`warning: function cannot return without recursing` on the rewritten
accessor. If you see two warnings of this shape back-to-back (one for
each `get_inner` body in `EngineCell` and `MaybeEngineCell`), the
rewriter misfired — revert those two bodies back to `&self.inner`.

**General lesson**: any audit-or-fix script that targets the *language
level* (R1.3 purity, R17.3 fields, etc.) must special-case *project-
level conventions* before blindly rewriting. The §19/§20 white lists
are exactly this kind of carve-out.

## 23. `#[macro_use] extern crate X;` is the only way to expose a macro to child modules

A common miss when migrating "dependency imports to lib.rs": the type
items (`X::TypeName`) can be re-exported via `pub use X::TypeName;` and
become reachable to sub-files via `use super::*;`, but the *macro items*
(`X::macro_name!`) cannot be re-exported via `use`. Macros are
textually scoped to the crate root, and the only way to make
`quote!` / `parse_macro_input!` callable from a child module is
`#[macro_use] extern crate quote;` at the top of `lib.rs` (Rust 2018+
also accepts `use quote::quote;` in `lib.rs` *only* if the call site is
itself in `lib.rs`).

**Concrete pattern from `euv-macros`** (`macros/src/lib.rs` after this
session's refactor):

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate syn;     // makes parse_macro_input! callable in raw_html.rs

// then all type re-exports stay as plain `use`:
use syn::LitStr;      // → raw_html.rs can `use super::*;` and reach LitStr
```

**Why `quote!` doesn't need `#[macro_use]`** in the same file: it has a
`use quote::quote;` in `lib.rs` which is enough to bring `quote!` into
the *crate root* namespace, and `lib.rs`'s own modules (`html/`,
`class/`, etc.) call `quote!` directly. The asymmetry: `#[macro_use]`
is only needed for macros that need to cross a `mod` boundary into a
child file.

**Verification**: after consolidation, run `cargo check -p <crate>` and
look for `cannot find macro 'X!' in this scope` in the child module
file. If it appears, add `#[macro_use] extern crate X;` to `lib.rs`.

## 24. private `use std::{...};` block vs `pub use std::{...};` — test-only items must be `pub`

The R6.1 rule "dependency imports go to lib.rs" is incomplete: sub-files
under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` need to reach those imports via
`super::*;`, but a *private* `use std::panic::catch_unwind;` in
`lib.rs` does NOT propagate through `pub use super::*;` (private use
items stay crate-private even when re-exported as part of a glob).

**Concrete pattern** (from `core/src/lib.rs`):

```rust
// WORKS for production code (private is fine — only this crate uses it)
use std::{ cell::Cell, rc::Rc, ... };

// WORKS for test code too — must be `pub use` so `core::tests::*` can see it
pub use std::{
    collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher,
    hash::{Hash, Hasher},
    panic::{AssertUnwindSafe, catch_unwind},
    vec::Vec,
};
```

**Detection**: `cargo check --tests` (not `cargo check --lib`) will
surface `cannot find function/type X in this scope` inside a test
`fn.rs`. The fix is to move the corresponding items from the private
`use std::{...}` block into the `pub use std::{...}` block, NOT to
re-add the `use` line inside the test file.




## 26. `change_*` setter naming — Lombok `Data` macro collision escape hatch

`rust-standards/references/07-naming.md` §7.2 mandates `snake_case` for
function names. The **implicit project-wide convention** (observed
across the master codebase) is direct verbs for setters: `set_*` (31
methods), `update_*` (10 methods), `with_*` (9 methods), `add_*`,
`remove_*`, `submit`, `validate`, `measure`, `prefetch`, `refetch`,
`toggle`, `tick`, `enter`, `exit`, `reset`, `clear`, etc. — **0
`change_*` methods** in master.

**However**, `#[derive(Data, New)]` from `lombok_macros` automatically
generates `set_<field>(&mut self, val: <FieldType>)` accessors for
every field. When a setter's semantics differ from the macro-generated
one, naming it `set_X` would either shadow the generated accessor (at
best a confusing name collision, at worst a compile error).

**Concrete examples** where the prefix `change_*` is the documented
correct escape hatch:

1. `I18n::change_locale(&self, locale: &str)` —
   `#[derive(Data)]` would generate `set_locale(&mut self, val: Signal<String>)`.
   The hand-written method accepts `&str` (not `Signal<String>`) and
   `&self` (not `&mut self`) because the field is itself a `Signal`,
   and writing into a signal only requires `&self` access. Doc comment:
   `Named 'change_locale' (not 'set_locale') to avoid colliding with
   the 'set_locale' getter generated by '#[derive(Data)]'.`

2. `I18n::change_fallback_locale(&self, locale: &str)` — same rationale.

3. `Transition::change_config(&self, config: TransitionConfig)` —
   Lombok would generate `set_config(&mut self, val: Signal<TransitionConfig>)`.
   The hand-written method accepts the full `TransitionConfig` value
   and writes it INTO the existing `Signal`. Doc comment:
   `Named 'change_config' (not 'set_config') to avoid colliding with
   the 'set_config' setter generated by '#[derive(Data)]'.`

4. `LazyComponent::change_factory(&self, factory: impl Fn() -> T + 'static)`
   — same pattern.

**Detection rule**: a `change_*` method is legitimate when **all four**
hold:
- the type's `struct.rs` declares `#[derive(Data, New)]` (or `Data` alone)
- the field being "set" is `Signal<T>` (not a plain `T`)
- the method accepts the inner `T` (not `Signal<T>`) and `&self` (not `&mut self`)
- the method's doc comment explicitly references the Lombok collision

**NOT legitimate**: introducing new `change_*` methods on types that
do NOT derive `Data`, or on types where the field is plain (not
wrapped in a `Signal`). The plain case has no Lombok collision and
`set_*` should be used.

This exception was confirmed by the audit of
`perf/renderer-and-signal-2026-08-24` where 4 `change_*` methods were
found — all 4 satisfy the criteria above (all derive `Data`, all have
`Signal<T>` fields, all accept the inner type, all have the
Lombok-collision doc comment).

**For top-level free functions in `fn.rs`**: a `change_*` function in
`fn.rs` is **NEVER** legitimate — if it's a free function it's not a
method, and the Lombok collision argument doesn't apply. Always use
`set_*` / `update_*` / `with_*` / etc. for free functions.
## 25. fn/const naming audit — verify against project baseline, not generic Rust rules

The rust-standards §5.2 / §7 rules establish generic Rust naming
(`snake_case` fn, `CamelCase` types, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` const). They do
NOT capture **project-specific** naming conventions like "setters use
`set_X` not `change_X`". When the user asks "is the PR naming compliant?",
a generic regex check returns "yes" for everything but misses the real
project-specific deviations.

**The audit method** (5 steps, run in this order):

1. **Identify the PR's "added fn" set, not the diff**.
   ```bash
   # Get fn declarations added by the PR (not just changed):
   git diff --diff-filter=AM -U0 BASE..HEAD -- '*.rs'      | grep -E '^\+.*fn \w+\s*[<(]'      | sed 's/^.*fn //' | sort -u
   ```
   The merge-base matters: `master..HEAD` includes prior PRs in the same
   branch; `df9c9c6..HEAD` includes only the perf PR's commits.
   Whichever range the user is reviewing, scope your audit to that range.

2. **Filter to production fns** (drop `tests/`, `wasm_only`, generic
   Rust trait impls like `new`/`default`/`clone`/`fmt`/`from`/`into`).
   Project-specific fns are the ones that need the convention check;
   generic trait impls are auto-derived.

3. **Build a project-baseline prefix frequency table**.
   ```bash
   git show master:$(git ls-tree --name-only -r master | grep '\.rs$' | head)      | grep -oE 'fn (set_\w+|change_\w+|update_\w+|with_\w+)'      | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```
   This answers "what prefix does the project ACTUALLY use for setters?"
   rather than "what prefix does Rust convention suggest?". Count zero
   `change_*` in master means `change_*` is project-banned, even though
   it's a perfectly valid English verb.

4. **Verify each new fn against (a) snake_case regex, (b) baseline
   prefix list, (c) descriptive semantic English, no abbreviations**.
   The third check matters: `try_reclaim_inactive` passes (try/reclaim/
   inactive are all standard English words), but `try_rec_inact` would
   fail even though it's snake_case.

5. **Verify consts against UPPER_SNAKE_CASE regex + the same
   descriptive-vocabulary check**. Constants encode project-specific
   intent (e.g. `MAX_ANCESTOR_DEPTH_FOR_HIGH_FREQ` — every component
   word must be standard English, no internal abbreviations).

**The "PR diff only" trap**: when PR #21 was reviewed for fn naming,
the initial scan showed `change_locale`, `change_factory`,
`change_config`, `change_fallback_locale` as "newly added" — but those
were actually introduced in PR #20 (the rust-standards refactor PR
whose commits `a70fe8b` → `df9c9c6` were already merged into the
branch). The perf PR `df9c9c6..HEAD` only added `try_reclaim_inactive`
+ 2 consts + 4 wasm_bindgen_test helpers. Always scope the naming
audit to the PR being reviewed, not the entire branch.

**Detection**: when the user asks "命名规范", "naming conventions", or
"PR 改动的所有 fn", ALWAYS:
- Use `git merge-base master HEAD` to find the true PR boundary.
- Run the diff against that boundary.
- Build the project baseline from `git show master:<file>` samples.
- Report findings with the project's actual prefix conventions,
  not generic Rust style rules.

## 27. fn-body `use std::xxx;` re-importing symbols already in lib.rs `pub use std::{...}` — REAL violation

Sub-files inherit `use super::*;` which globs every symbol re-exported
by the parent `mod.rs` (which in turn re-exports from `lib.rs`'s `pub
use std::{...}` block). If a sub-file's function body adds a redundant
`use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};` (or any std / project
symbol already exposed via the chain), rustc emits a compile error
(unambiguous glob) **or** clippy fires `unused_imports` — both are
review-blocking.

**Concrete pattern (PR #202, euv keyed-diff planner)**:
- Before: `fn.rs::compute_child_ops_plan` opened with
  `use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};` even though `lib.rs` line
  18 has `pub use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet, VecDeque};`.
- After: remove the in-fn `use`; sub-file accesses `HashMap` /
  `HashSet` directly via the `use super::*;` chain.

**Detection rule**:
- Before committing a sub-file, grep the file body for any `use` line
  that re-imports a symbol already in `lib.rs`'s `pub use` block:
  ```bash
  grep -nE '^    use |^        use ' <crate>/src/<sub>/fn.rs | grep std
  ```
  Every hit is a candidate for removal.
- Audit script cannot statically detect this (it doesn't model which
  symbols lib.rs re-exports); review manually.

**NOT a violation**:
- `use std::collections::HashMap;` in `lib.rs` itself (the entry point
  — no super::* above).
- `use std::path::PathBuf;` in a `fn.rs` if `PathBuf` is **not** in
  lib.rs's `pub use std::{...}` block.
- `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; use std::time::Instant; }`
  if the test needs `Instant` and lib.rs doesn't re-export it.

## 28. `pub(crate) enum` / `pub(crate) type` declared inside `fn.rs` — REAL violation (§1.3 keyword purity)

`fn.rs` is one of the 9 keyword-only files (§1.3). It accepts only
`fn` declarations + free functions. New types (`pub(crate) enum
ChildOpPlan`, `pub(crate) struct FooBar`, `pub(crate) type MyAlias =
...`, `impl X for Y`) declared directly inside `fn.rs` violate §1.3
purity and the audit script's category 1 (`non-keyword prod files`)
won't catch it because the file basename **is** `fn.rs`.

**Concrete pattern (PR #202)**:
- Before: `core/src/renderer/render/fn.rs` contained
  `pub(crate) enum ChildOpPlan { ... }` inline with `lis_indices` and
  `compute_child_ops_plan`.
- After: move `ChildOpPlan` to a new `core/src/renderer/render/enum.rs`
  (first line `use super::*;`), declare it in `mod.rs` as
  `mod r#enum;` + `pub(crate) use {r#enum::*};` (§6.2 strict three-
  segment).

**Detection rule**:
- Before declaring any new type / impl / trait in a sub-file, check
  the file's keyword by basename:
  `const.rs` → only const; `static.rs` → only static; `fn.rs` → only
  fn; `enum.rs` → only enum; `struct.rs` → only struct; `trait.rs` →
  only trait; `impl.rs` → only impl; `type.rs` → only type alias.
- `grep -nE '^(pub |pub\(crate\) )?(struct|type|enum|trait|impl)' <file>`
  should return zero matches (comments / doc strings excepted).
- `fn.rs` and `struct.rs` are the most common offenders because they
  get used as "grab-bag" files; resist the temptation.

**NOT a violation**:
- `type TestKeyList = Vec<Option<&'static str>>;` inside
  `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` — test-module-only type alias
  doesn't pollute the file's production purity.
- Any keyword file that contains only its declared keyword (e.g.
  `enum.rs` containing only `pub(crate) enum Foo { ... }`).

## 29. Blank lines inside fn bodies — REAL violation (§9.1 item 10)

`rust-standards/references/09-follow-existing.md` §9.1 item 10
explicitly forbids blank lines inside function bodies. Section
breaks are expressed by comment lines (`// Phase 1: ...`,
`// Pass 3: emit Remove for ...`), not by blank lines. The previous
implementation style of "blank line then comment header then code"
does not match this project's master convention.

**Concrete pattern (PR #202)**:
- Before: comment blocks inside `patch_children_keyed` were separated
  by single blank lines (line 718 was the only true blank inside the
  fn body — between comment block and code).
- After: blank line removed; `// OPT 16: ...` comment sits flush
  against the previous code line.

**Detection rule**:
- For every `pub fn` / `pub(crate) fn` / `fn` body in a PR's diff,
  walk from the `)` opening brace to the matching `}` and count blank
  lines (`^$`). Each blank is a §9.1 violation.
- A quick awk one-liner:
  ```bash
  awk '
    /pub fn |pub\(crate\) fn |^fn / && !in_fn { in_fn=1; start=NR; blanks=0; next }
    in_fn && /^}$/ { if (blanks > 0) print FILENAME ":" start "-" NR ": " blanks " blank line(s) in fn body"; in_fn=0; next }
    in_fn && /^$/ { blanks++ }
    in_fn && /^\s*\/\// { next }  # comment lines don't count as breaks
  ' <file>
  ```
- `euv fmt` and `cargo fmt` do **not** auto-remove fn-body blanks
  (they only format whitespace around tokens, not inter-statement
  spacing inside a block). Review manually.

**NOT a violation**:
- Blank lines **between** `#[test] fn a() { ... }` and `#[test] fn b() { ... }`
  inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` — test separators are
  idiomatic.
- Blank lines **between** free functions at file scope (after the
  closing `}` of fn A and before the doc comment of fn B) — that
  space separates top-level items, not fn bodies.
- Blank lines inside struct / enum literals (e.g. between struct
  fields with explicit visual grouping).

## 30. audit script rule 8 broken regex — silent false-positive (audit-pitfalls #10's hidden bug)

`audit_rust_standards.py` rule 8 ("`#[cfg(test)]` in production", R14.5)
historically had a broken ERE regex that made the rule silently PASS
even when real inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` violations
existed in the diff.

**The bug** (pre-2026-09-12):

```python
('#[cfg(test)] in production', '''
cd {target}
git diff -U0 origin/master HEAD -- "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "^\\+.*#\\[(test|cfg\\(test\\)\\)" | head -20
'''),
```

The Python triple-quoted string is fed through `.format(target=target)`
(which preserves backslashes literally) and then handed to bash via
`subprocess.run(['bash', '-c', cmd])`. After both escape layers, grep
saw a malformed ERE with unmatched parentheses and printed
`grep: Unmatched ( or \\(` to stderr while r.stdout stayed empty — the
rule printed "PASS: 8. #[cfg(test)] in production" because the script
counts `r.stdout` lines, not stderr.

**Why this matters**:

- The rule was supposed to catch inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` per
  §14.4 (single-tests must live in `tests/` directory, not inline).
- Anyone reading "14/14 PASS" thought their inline tests were
  compliant when in fact the audit was failing silently.
- Rule 4 ("#[test] in production", separate grep) had the same
  escape-layer bug for a different regex — fixed in the same pass.

**The fix** (2026-09-12):

Replace `grep -E <regex>` with `grep -F <literal>` whenever the rule
needs to match a fixed Rust token:

```python
('#[cfg(test)] in production', '''
cd {target}
git diff -U0 origin/master HEAD -- "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | grep -F "#[cfg(test)]" | grep -v "^[+][+][+] b/" | grep "^[+]" | head -20
'''),
```

`grep -F` interprets the pattern literally — no ERE parsing, no
parentheses/backslash collision. The `grep -v "^[+][+][+] b/"` strips
the diff "+++ b/path" header lines so only actual `+` content lines
remain.

**Detection when adding a new audit rule**:

When you write a new `CHECKS.append((name, shell_template))` block,
before committing:

1. Run the rule directly in a shell with the same template format to
   verify it actually emits output when a violation exists:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-root>
   <paste the shell_template body, replacing {target} with the path>
   ```
2. Verify the rule FAILS (prints hits) when the diff contains a
   violation, and PASSES when the diff is clean.
3. **Never** trust "PASS" until you have manually confirmed a known
   violation triggers "FAIL".

If the rule keeps PASSing despite visible violations, check
`r.stderr` from `subprocess.run([...])` for `grep: ...` errors — that's
the symptom of a broken ERE.

**Master-exception exemption REMOVED (2026-09-12 user 第二轮)**:

user 原话:

> "src里所有单测删除,有tests目录是单测的,如果单测的功能不是pub那就忽略"

这条把 §14.4 的"master 例外 pattern"(允许 `pub(crate)` item 用 `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` + `// These tests live inline` 注释保留 inline 测试)**完全推翻**。现在的规则:

- 任何 inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` 块 = violation,不管有没有 `// These tests live inline` 注释。
- `pub(crate)` item 没有单元测试——算法正确性必须通过 `pub` API 的 end-to-end 测试间接覆盖。
- `pub` item 的测试必须搬到 `<crate>/tests/<feature>/fn.rs`,不能改 visibility。

**audit script rule 8 修改**:删掉 `// These tests live inline` 注释的 exemption,任何 `+#[cfg(test)]` 行都 FAIL。**euv PR #203 实测**:core/src/renderer/render/fn.rs 922 行 inline tests + engine 三个 inline tests + master 注释全部删除/迁移。

**迁移目标**:
- `pub(crate)` fn 关联的 inline 测试 → **整块删除**(不带任何注释保留)。
- `pub` fn 关联的 inline 测试 → 搬到 `<crate>/tests/<feature>/fn.rs`,开头 `use euv_engine::*;` / `use euv_core::*;`(该 crate 的 `pub use` re-export 链)。

**§14.4 文档同步**:`references/14-testing.md` 已更新,删掉"master 例外 pattern"小节,改为"`pub(crate)` item 的测试怎么办 — DELETE,不保留 inline"。

## 31. audit rule + SKILL.md rule consistency — single source of truth

Adding a new rust-standards rule requires updating FOUR places
consistently:

1. **SKILL.md** (`key-rules` pitfall callout) — the rule itself.
2. **references/<topic>.md** — the long-form justification + examples.
3. **references/audit-pitfalls.md** — false-positive / false-negative
   catalog if applicable.
4. **scripts/audit_rust_standards.py** — mechanical enforcement
   (when a regex/static check can express it).

**Skipping any of the four** creates a knowledge gap that bites future
sessions. Concrete example from this session:

- §14.4 "single-tests in tests/ only" was added to `references/14-testing.md`
  AND rule 8 of audit script was fixed to actually catch it.
- §6.4 "no fn-body `use std::xxx;` re-imports" was added to
  `references/06-module-imports.md` AND audit-pitfalls #27 cataloged
  the violation pattern (audit script can't statically detect it
  because it doesn't model lib.rs's `pub use` chain, so manual review
  is the only enforcement).
- §1.3a "keyword file purity enforcement" was added to
  `references/01-directory-structure.md` AND audit-pitfalls #28
  cataloged it.

**Checklist when adding a new rule**:

1. Write the rule prose in the most specific references file (where
   the topic naturally belongs).
2. If it can be statically checked: add a CHECKS entry to
   `audit_rust_standards.py` and **verify** the rule with a known
   violation (see §30 detection steps above).
3. If it can't be statically checked: add an audit-pitfalls entry
   cataloging the false-positive catalog (#N above) so the next
   session knows it's a manual-review item.
4. Update SKILL.md's "key rules" section with a one-line callout
   linking to the references file.
5. Mention in commit message which of the four you updated.

**Sign of missing step 4** — when you read SKILL.md's "key rules"
section and a documented rule has no callout, future agents loading
the skill for the first time won't know it exists. Always cross-link
SKILL.md ↔ references ↔ audit script.

## 32. WGSL shader raw strings in `const.rs` — re-scan with raw-string-aware parser (refines §18)

`audit-pitfalls #18` documents that `struct` / `fn` at column 0 inside
WGSL shader raw strings are **not** violations. But the §18 entry only
names the **symptom** (false positive in column-0 keyword scans) — it
does not give a **re-scan recipe** for a future session that hits it.

This session (2026-09-12, euv PR #202 + master §1.3a audit) found that
**master has 38 such false positives** in
`example/src/page/{game_2d,game_3d,lighting,raytrace}/hook/const.rs` —
all `pub(crate) const *_WEBGPU_SHADER: &str = r#" ... "#;` blocks
containing WGSL `struct BallData { ... }` / `fn vs_main(...)` etc. at
column 0.

**The raw-string-aware re-scan recipe** (Python; runnable as a
`while`-loop replacement for the broken scan):

```python
import os, re

# per-file state
in_raw_string = False
raw_delim = None  # "#" / "##" / etc.

for line in file:
    # skip line/block comments (audit-pitfalls #10)
    ...
    if in_raw_string:
        close_marker = f'"{raw_delim}'
        if close_marker in line:
            pos = line.find(close_marker)
            after = line[pos + len(close_marker):]
            in_raw_string = False
            # process `after` as code (re-enter the brace / keyword loop)
            ...
        continue  # line fully consumed by raw-string contents
    # detect raw-string start
    m = re.search(r'r(#+)["\']', line)
    if m:
        delim = m.group(1)
        close_marker = f'"{delim}'
        pos_start = line.find(m.group(0))
        pre = line[:pos_start]
        # process `pre` as code
        ...
        rest = line[pos_start + len(m.group(0)):]
        if close_marker in rest:
            pos_close = rest.find(close_marker)
            after = rest[pos_close + len(close_marker):]
            # process `after` as code
            ...
            continue
        in_raw_string = True
        raw_delim = delim
        continue
    # normal code line — apply the keyword scan
    ...
```

**Three invariants this scanner must preserve** to be correct:

1. **Block-comment / line-comment skip** before raw-string detection
   (comments can contain `r#"..."#` literally; if you don't skip them,
   the state machine mis-flips).
2. **Pre-raw-string code (`pre`)** — anything before the `r#"..."#` token
   on the same line still needs to be scanned as code (e.g. the `pub(crate) const NAME: &str =` prefix on line 1 of the shader const).
3. **Post-raw-string code (`after`)** — anything after the closing `r#"..."#` on the same line is also code (rare in master, but possible if a shader const is on the same line as a `;` or other code).

**Master occurrences to ignore** (re-scan post-filter):
- `example/src/page/game_2d/hook/const.rs` — `GAME_2D_WEBGPU_SHADER` r#"..."#
- `example/src/page/game_3d/hook/const.rs` — `GAME_3D_WEBGPU_SHADER` r#"..."#
- `example/src/page/lighting/hook/const.rs` — `LIGHTING_WEBGPU_SHADER` r#"..."#
- `example/src/page/raytrace/hook/const.rs` — `RAYTRACE_WEBGPU_SHADER` r#"..."#

After applying the raw-string-aware scan, the count drops from 38 to 0
true violations — all were shader code.

## 33. Brace-tracking scanner for §9.5 (fn-body blank lines) — false-positive traps

The naïve "track global brace depth, treat every `{` as fn-body start"
scanner produces **40+ false positives** in master (verified this
session, 2026-09-12). Three classes of false positive that the naive
scanner must special-case:

1. **`use std::{ ... }` blocks** (blank lines inside the use list, e.g.
   `cli/src/lib.rs:24`) — these are NOT inside a fn body even though
   brace depth > 0.
2. **`pub trait Foo { fn method_a(&self); fn method_b(&self); }`** — blank
   lines between trait method signatures are idiomatic Rust; not a §9.5
   violation.
3. **`pub const A: ...; ... pub const B: ...;` blocks** inside `const.rs` —
   blank lines between const items are not inside a fn body.

**The fix**: classify the brace-opening context, not just count braces.
Before pushing onto the brace stack, look at the text up to and
including the `{`:

```python
import re

def is_fn_open(prefix: str) -> bool:
    """prefix is the text up to and including the opening brace.
    Returns True iff this brace opens a function body."""
    s = prefix.rstrip().rstrip("{").rstrip()
    # Last word sequence before the brace must be a fn keyword:
    #   fn foo() -> ...
    #   pub fn foo() -> ...
    #   pub(crate) async unsafe const fn foo() -> ...
    return bool(re.search(
        r'\b(fn|async\s+fn|const\s+fn|unsafe\s+fn|pub(\([^)]*\))?\s+fn)\b\s*$',
        s,
    ))
```

The naïve regex `^(pub(\([^)]*\))?\s\w+\s+\w)` (matches `pub trait Collider`
because "trait" is `\w+`) **fails** because it doesn't require the
keyword to be `fn`. The fix above requires the last word(s) before `{`
to be `fn` / `async fn` / etc. — false-positive rate drops from 42 hits
to 0 hits on master.

**Other context flags to push instead of "fn"**:
- `mod tests { ... }` preceded by `#[cfg(test)]` attribute → push `test`
  (the scanner checks the preceding ~4 lines for `cfg(test)`).
- `use { ... }` / `const { ... }` / `static { ... }` / `trait { ... }` /
  `impl { ... }` / `mod { ... }` → push `other`.

Then in the blank-line check, only count as a §9.5 violation when the
topmost "fn" frame on the stack is **not** under a "test" frame (i.e.
production fn body, not test fn body).

**Master confirmed-false-positive sites** (after fix, scanner reports 0
hits at these locations):
- `core/src/renderer/dom/trait.rs:21` (trait method separator)
- `engine/src/collider/trait.rs:11,18,29` (trait method separators)
- `engine/src/entity/trait.rs:32` (trait method separator)
- `engine/src/renderer/trait.rs:22-...` (trait method separators)
- `engine/src/scene/trait.rs:10` (trait method separator)
- `engine/src/scheduler/trait.rs:12` (trait method separator)
- `cli/src/fmt/const.rs:53` (const item separator)
- `core/src/vdom/attribute/const.rs:23,50` (const item separators)
- `macros/src/class/const.rs:57` (const item separator)
- `macros/src/lib.rs:21` (`use std::{...}` block separator)
- `ui/src/lib.rs:11` (`use std::{...}` block separator)

## 34. `fn` in `fn.rs` is **crate-private** by default — needs `pub(crate)` for sibling `impl.rs` use

When moving a free function from `impl.rs` to `fn.rs` (per §1.3 keyword
purity), the function is now in a different sibling file. The
mod.rs `pub(crate) use r#fn::*` glob re-exports only **public +
pub(crate)** symbols. A plain `fn name(...)` (no `pub`) is **private**
to the fn.rs file itself; the sibling `impl.rs` cannot see it via
`use super::*;` even though the mod.rs glob re-exports `r#fn::*`.

**Concrete failure (this session, euv PR #202 + style cleanup)**:

After moving `cached_method_name` from `impl.rs` to `fn.rs`, cargo
emits `error[E0425]: cannot find function 'cached_method_name' in
this scope` at every callsite in `impl.rs`. Fix:

```rust
// engine/src/renderer/fn.rs
- fn cached_method_name(name: &'static str) -> JsValue {
+ pub(crate) fn cached_method_name(name: &'static str) -> JsValue {
```

Same pattern for `messages_lock` (i18n), `cached_method`,
`cached_method_call`, `fmt_lit_str` (macros) — all needed `pub(crate)`
after the §1.3 move.

**Detection**:
- Before moving a `fn` between sibling sub-files, grep the source crate
  for the function name: `git grep -nE 'fn name\(' -- '*.rs'`.
- After the move + first compile, if cargo emits E0425 at callsites
  outside the fn.rs file, add `pub(crate)`.

**NOT applicable**:
- `pub fn` is already public; sibling files see it via the glob.
- Free functions that are **only called from within fn.rs itself** stay
  plain `fn` (no `pub(crate)` needed).
- Methods inside `impl X { fn ... }` blocks are governed by the impl
  block's visibility, not the file-level `pub(crate)` requirement.

## 35. `audit_rust_standards.py` regex escape double-layer (Python `format()` + bash + grep ERE) — verification protocol

This session found that `audit_rust_standards.py` rule 8 had a broken
ERE regex (see §30) that PASSED silently despite real violations.
The root cause is **double-layer escaping**: the regex lives inside a
Python triple-quoted string that is fed through `.format(target=target)`
(preserves backslashes literally) and then handed to bash via
`subprocess.run(['bash', '-c', cmd])` (one more shell parse), and
finally to `grep -E` (one more ERE parse).

Three backslash layers, three chances for the regex to break. Every
existing audit rule that uses `grep -E` should be re-verified by:

1. **Run the rule manually in a shell** with a known violation:
   ```bash
   cd /root/github/<owner>/<repo>
   git diff -U0 origin/master HEAD -- "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | \
     grep -E "<exact-pattern-from-script>" | head -20
   ```
   The output should NOT be empty; if it is, the regex is broken.

2. **Verify `r.stderr` is clean** — broken ERE produces
   `grep: Unmatched ( or \\(` on stderr. If you see this, the rule is
   silently broken regardless of what `r.stdout` says.

3. **Check `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True)` exit code** —
   `grep` returns 1 when no match is found. If the rule shell template
   ends with `head -20`, the pipeline exit code is `head`'s (always 0),
   masking the `grep` failure.

**Prefer `grep -F <literal>` over `grep -E <regex>`** for fixed Rust
tokens (rule 8's `#[cfg(test)]`, rule 4's `#[test]`, rule 3's
`panic!`, etc.). `grep -F` interprets the pattern literally — no
parentheses/backslash collision possible. Use `grep -E` only when the
pattern genuinely needs alternation or quantifiers.

**Rules in this audit script that should be re-verified with a known
violation**:

| Rule | Pattern | Risk | Fix |
|------|---------|------|-----|
| 3 | `panic!(\|\.expect\(\|\.unwrap\(\)` (in shell template) | backslash collision | `grep -F` "panic!" + separate `grep -F` ".expect(" + "grep -F" ".unwrap("; OR `grep -E` verified |
| 4 | `^#[test]` | low | OK |
| 8 | `^\\+.*#\\[(test\|cfg\\(test\\)\\)\\]` | **HIGH — was broken** | `grep -F "#[cfg(test)]"` (fixed 2026-09-12) |
| 11 | `mod r#<keyword>` | low (literal `r#` prefix) | OK |
| 13 | `^#!\[cfg\(test\)\]` | medium — backslash collision | `grep -F "#![cfg(test)]"` |
| 14 | `^pub(crate) fn .*\(self\)` | low | OK |

**Add a `verify_audit_rules.py` script** under `scripts/` (per the
"§31 single source of truth" checklist) that walks every `CHECKS.append`
rule, injects a synthetic violation into a temp file, runs the rule,
and confirms `r.stdout` is non-empty. Skip if the rule has no
synthesizable violation (e.g. file-level scans that need real `.rs` files).


### 35-B. Python heredoc inside `r'''` shell template — every `{` and `}` must be doubled, even outside `.format()` callsites

When a `CHECKS.append` rule's shell template embeds a `python3 - <<'PY' ... PY`
heredoc, **every literal `{` and `}` inside the heredoc is interpreted by
`.format(target=target)` in `run_check`** — not just the `{target}` placeholder.
Audit check 17 (the new "sub-file body uses external crate full path"
rule) had three separate unescape bugs that crashed with
`IndexError: Replacement index 0 out of range for positional args tuple`:

1. `IGNORE = {"std", "core", ...}` — the Python set literal `{...}` was
   consumed by `.format()`. Fix: `IGNORE = {{"std", "core", ...}}`.
2. `added_lines = {}` — the empty dict literal. Fix: `added_lines = {{}}`.
3. Any `{` `}` in regex literals inside the heredoc, e.g.
   `re.match(r"\{", line)` becomes a malformed pattern after `.format()`
   passes the single `{` through. Fix: double them too (`{{` `}}`).

**Symptom** is always the same: a rule that worked in isolation crashes
when the audit script runs `cmd = shell_template.format(target=target)`,
because `.format()` raises `IndexError` on any unmatched positional
placeholder (even just `{}`). The traceback is at
`audit_rust_standards.py:391: cmd = shell_template.format(target=target)`.

**Defense**: after editing any shell template in `CHECKS.append`, run

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(
    "a", "/root/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/audit_rust_standards.py")
m = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(m)
for n, t in m.CHECKS:
    m.run_check(n, t, "/root/github/euv-dev/euv")
```

Every rule should produce empty output (no false positives on a clean
repo); any rule that crashes or hits an `IndexError` has an unescaped
`{}` somewhere.

### 35-C. `'''` close can be silently missing between adjacent `CHECKS.append` entries — Python sees one long string instead of N

When a `CHECKS.append` rule ends with a multi-line `r'''...''')` and the
next entry starts on the line after, **the audit script silently
concatenates them** if the closing `''')` is missing from entry N.
The first entry looks "fine" because the syntax parses (the open `r'''`
of entry N+1 closes entry N's string), and entry N+1 picks up where
entry N's content left off. This causes:

- Entry N's actual close `'''),` is missing → N's content leaks into
  N+1 → N+1's shell template contains unrelated code.
- Audit reports fewer rules than expected (the audit prints "N/17 PASS"
  instead of "16/17 PASS") because two entries merged into one.
- No syntax error — Python is happy with the merged string.

**Symptom**: `audit_rust_standards.py` reports fewer total checks than
the `len(CHECKS)` you expect, OR `rule X` shows up named for what should
be rule Y. Diagnostic:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(
    "a", "/root/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/audit_rust_standards.py")
m = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(m)
print(len(m.CHECKS))   # should match the "X/Y PASS" output's Y
```

**Defense**:

```bash
grep -nE "^'''\),$|^r'''$" /root/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/audit_rust_standards.py
```

should print exactly `2 × len(CHECKS)` lines (each entry has one open
`r'''`/`'''` and one close `'''),`). Mismatch → some entry's close is
missing.

### 35-D. Check 17 R6.4-pitfall-b — too broad, then over-narrowed; final scope is "top-of-file `use` and type annotations only"

R6.3 / §6.4 spirit says sub-files should reach external symbols via
`use super::*;` and `lib.rs` re-export, not via qualified full paths.
But §6.3 *literal* only forbids two patterns:

1. Top-of-file `use external_crate::xxx;` (R6.3)
2. `let x: external_crate::Type = ...` type annotations (R6.4 spirit)

It does **not** forbid:

- `log::warn!(...)` macro calls
- `tokio::fs::read(&path)` qualified path calls
- `clap::Parser` derive macro paths
- `serde_json::from_str` qualified function calls

An earlier version of check 17 grepped `\b<ext>::[A-Za-z_]` across the
whole file (not just `+` diff lines) and treated macro calls as
violations, producing 41 false positives on a single PR (all `log::warn!`,
plus historical `tokio::fs::*` calls that were already merged). The
fixed version of check 17 only scans **added lines from
`git diff -U0 origin/master HEAD -- <file>`**, and only matches the two
literal patterns above (top-of-file `use`, type-annotation `:`).

**If you change check 17's regex, reproduce both directions**:

- Add a synthetic `use external_crate::xxx;` to a test diff → expect 1 hit
- Add a synthetic `log::warn!("...")` to a test diff → expect 0 hits
- Add a synthetic `let x: external_crate::Type = ...;` → expect 1 hit
- Add a synthetic `tokio::fs::read(...)` call → expect 0 hits

If any of these expectations are wrong, the regex is over- or
under-matching. Also remember the §35-B escape rule: any `{` or `}` in
the heredoc must be `{{` / `}}` to survive `.format(target=target)`.


## 36. `rust-analyzer` lint false positive on Rust 2024 `let chains` and `async fn` — don't trust editor lints blindly

This session moved several declarations across files. After every move,
`patch` and `read_file` reported lint errors like:

```
error[E0670]: `async fn` is not permitted in Rust 2015
  --> engine/src/engine/impl.rs:44:9
   |
44 |     pub async fn run(config: EngineConfig, handler: TickHandlerRc) -> EngineHandle {
   |         ^^^^^ to use `async fn`, switch to Rust 2018 or later
```

`let chains` similarly:
```
error: let chains are only allowed in Rust 2024 or later
   --> macros/src/html/fn.rs:334:12
```

Both were **false positives** because:
- The repo's `core/Cargo.toml`, `engine/Cargo.toml`, etc. all set `edition = "2024"`.
- The patch tool's lint runs **rust-analyzer in standalone mode** without picking up the workspace's `Cargo.toml`, so it defaults to Rust 2015/2018 syntax checking.

**Detection**:
- When `patch` or `read_file` reports a lint error AFTER a successful
  `cargo check`/`cargo build`, the lint is almost certainly a
  rust-analyzer false positive.
- The error message is the giveaway: `Rust 2015` / `Rust 2018` when
  the workspace edition is `2024`.

**Action**: trust `cargo check` exit code (or `cargo build --tests`),
not the lint output. Continue with the move + commit + push workflow.
The lint false positive does not affect the actual compilation.

**When the lint IS real** (e.g. genuinely missing edition upgrade or
real syntax error): the lint output ALSO shows up in `cargo check`
stderr. If `cargo check` exits 0, the file is fine.

## 29.1 patch tool deletes preceding `///` doc-comment block when old_string starts mid-function — verified 2026-09-14 (euv-cli inline-js minify PR #233)

**Symptom**: A patch with `old_string` of the form
`<last line of preceding function's body>\n<blank line>\n/// - &Path - ...\n///\n/// - &Path - description.\npub async fn some_fn(...) {`
silently deletes the preceding function's `///` doc comment (4–8 lines
above the matched position). Worse, attempting to "re-patch" the deleted
doc comment back in by adding a fresh `/// Cleans ...\n/// Cleans ...`
block creates **duplicated `///` lines** that no longer compile-cleanly
even by lint standards — the duplicate-merge is itself malformed and
requires a third patch to fully restore.

**Why**: the patch tool's fuzzy match collapses multiple `///` lines
above the matched anchor into whitespace-equivalent noise, dropping them
on the assumption that they are decorative comments the user is replacing
as a unit. The pattern that triggers it: `old_string` ending with
`<code line>` + `\n` + `<blank line>` + `/// ...` + `pub async fn X()`.

**Detection**:
- After every multi-line patch that includes `///` doc-comment lines,
  immediately `git diff <file>` and confirm the actual file structure
  matches intent (especially doc comments around non-edited functions).
- `git diff --stat` showing 0 deleted lines but `wc -l <file>` decreased
  → indicates patch tool deleted content silently.

**Action**: prefer Python `re.sub` over `patch` for any change that
touches `///` doc-comment blocks around a function signature. The
replacement string itself stays clear of `///` ambiguity. Specifically:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path
text = Path("file.rs").read_text()
new_text = re.sub(r'<single-line anchor pattern>', '<replacement>', text, count=1)
Path("file.rs").write_text(new_text)
```

If `patch` is unavoidable, **anchor the old_string on a unique token
that lives INSIDE the doc comment** (e.g. the function name) rather
than on the function-signature line, and include the doc-comment lines
IN the replacement string verbatim to avoid the silent-deletion bug:

```
old_string:
/// Cleans the output directory before a fresh build.
///
/// Removes all files and subdirectories within the output directory
/// so that stale artifacts from previous builds do not remain.
/// The directory itself is preserved (recreated if missing).
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - &Path - The output directory to clean.
pub async fn clean_out_dir(out_dir: &Path) {

new_string:
/// Cleans the output directory before a fresh build.
/// ... full new doc ...
pub async fn clean_out_dir(out_dir: &Path) {
```

**Recovery**: when the bug fires, `git checkout HEAD -- <file>` and
retry with a Python script. Don't try to amend the deletion — the
3-step recovery (delete-clean, recover-via-patch, de-duplicate) costs
more than the rebuild.


## 30. audit rule 8 (#[cfg(test)] detection) broken regex — fixed 2026-09-12

**Symptom**: audit script rule 8 `grep -E "^\\+.*#\\[(test|cfg\\(test\\)\\)"` (Python format → shell escape → grep ERE) failed because `\\(` in ERE is invalid syntax. `grep` emitted `Unmatched ( or \(` to stderr and stdout was empty, so the rule always reported PASS — **false-positive PASS** even when `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` truly exists in production code.

**Detection**:
- Run audit in isolation: `python3 ~/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/audit_rust_standards.py <repo>`.
- If rule 8 reports PASS but you KNOW your PR has `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inline, audit rule 8 is broken.

**Action**: rewritten rule 8 to use `grep -F "#[cfg(test)]"` (fixed string match) plus master-exception check (lines containing `// These tests live inline` explanation comment are skipped — see §14.4 master pattern).

**Verified**: rule 8 now correctly reports FAIL when a new file adds inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` without master-exception comment.

## 31. audit rule 15 (R1.3a raw-string-aware keyword purity) — added 2026-09-12

**Why**: rule 1 only checks for non-keyword basename (e.g. `foo.rs` outside the 8 keyword-file names). It did NOT catch column-0 decl mismatches WITHIN keyword files (e.g. `pub(crate) enum X` declared in `struct.rs`, which is forbidden).

**Detection**: rule 15 walks each keyword file modified by the PR, parses column-0 decl lines, and flags any decl whose keyword type does not match the file's allowed type. Example:
- `fn.rs` should only contain `fn` decls → `pub(crate) enum Foo` in `fn.rs` is FAIL.
- `struct.rs` should only contain `struct` decls → `pub(crate) enum Bar` in `struct.rs` is FAIL.

**Raw-string aware**: when a column-0 `struct BallData { ... }` line appears INSIDE a `pub(crate) const GAME_2D_WEBGPU_SHADER: &str = r#"..."#;` raw string, it is a WGSL shader code, NOT a Rust decl → not flagged.

**Action**: any FAIL of rule 15 in your PR means you declared a wrong-type item in a keyword file. Move the decl to the correct keyword file per §1.3a:
- `enum Foo` → `enum.rs`
- `struct Bar` → `struct.rs`
- `fn baz()` → `fn.rs`
- `impl X { ... }` → `impl.rs`
- `trait T { ... }` → `trait.rs`
- `type Alias = ...` → `type.rs`
- `const FOO` / `static BAR` → `const.rs` / `static.rs`

**Verified**: rule 15 catches all column-0 decl mismatches that rule 1 missed, including the historical euv master violations (PR #202 cleanup) and WGSL shader code in raw strings (correctly excluded).

## 37. `tests/` comment rules — user iteration pattern + audit rule 16 false-positive traps

User went through three rounds of corrections on the same `tests/` topic, each round strictly tightening the rule. Future sessions debugging "why does audit rule 16 fire?" need to know the exact scope and the false-positive traps:

### Round 1 (2026-09-12): §14.4 — no visibility widening for tests

User 原话:
> "你不应该修改模块可见性,你应该使用已有可见的api去在tests里做单测,通过已有的api覆盖,没有暴露的api的单测"

So `pub(crate)` items have no tests — `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks testing them must be **deleted entirely**, not moved.

### Round 2 (2026-09-12): §14.4 — no inline `mod tests` at all

User 原话:
> "src里所有单测删除,有tests目录是单测的,如果单测的功能不是pub那就忽略,如果是pub就加到tests里"

This nuked the prior "master-exception" exemption (§14.4 master pattern `// These tests live inline` comment as a marker). ALL inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks are forbidden across the whole codebase. Tests for `pub` items move to `<crate>/tests/<feature>/fn.rs`; tests for `pub(crate)` items are deleted.

### Round 3 (2026-09-12): §14.5 — no comments in tests

User 原话:
> "单测不需要任何注释,删除所有单测注释"

Tests have zero comments — no file-level `//!`, no per-fn `///`, no fn-body inline `//`. Test fn name = documentation; assertion messages = expected behavior.

### Audit rule 16 implementation + false-positive traps

```bash
# Real implementation in audit_rust_standards.py (rule 16):
for f in $(git diff --name-only origin/master HEAD -- "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "/tests/.*\\.rs$"); do
  hits=$(grep -nE "^\s*//[^/]" "$f" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$hits" ]; then
    echo "FAIL: $f has comments:"
    echo "$hits" | head -3
  fi
done
```

The regex `^\s*//[^/]` matches:
- `// normal comment` — FAIL (correct)
- `//path/with/slashes` — FAIL (false positive — a `//` URL fragment in a comment or string would also match, but tests shouldn't contain URL fragments anyway)
- `/// doc comment` — does NOT match (good — the regex requires `[^/]` after `//`, so `///` becomes `//` + `/` = second char is `/`, doesn't match)

Note: rule 16 does NOT separately detect `///` or `//!` — they fall under the same rule because the pattern requires the next char after `//` to NOT be `/`. So `///` and `//!` are excluded (good — they're handled separately by rule 5/§14.4).

If rule 16 fires on a test file, the action is: **delete every comment line**. There are NO exemptions. Reformat test fn names if they're ambiguous; add `.clone()` to `assert_eq!` calls instead of explaining "we compare owned values". Use the assertion message parameter for any necessary clarification:

```rust
// ❌ Forbidden (any context in tests/)
// Comment explaining the test
#[test]
fn foo() {
    // inline comment
    assert!(x);
}

// ✅ Correct: bare test, self-documenting
#[test]
fn foo_returns_true_when_input_is_positive() {
    let x = compute();
    assert!(x, "compute() must return true for positive input");
}
```

### Top-level integration-test mod.rs `use super::*;` is invalid Rust

`engine/tests/mod.rs` / `ui/tests/mod.rs` / `core/tests/mod.rs` are at the integration-test crate root — `super::*` would be "too many leading super keywords" (E0433). Rule 6 already excludes these from the trailing-`use super::*;` check. Engine / ui top-level mod.rs end with `use wasm_bindgen::JsValue;` (after any `use std::{...};`); core top-level mod.rs ends with `use std::{...};` or similar. Do not try to add `use super::*;` here.

**Verified**: euv PR #203 final state, audit rule 16 PASSES with 30/30 engine tests + 0 core inline tests, all comment-stripped.

## 38. CI `cargo fmt --check` is stricter than local `cargo fmt` (version skew pitfall)

2026-09-12 PR #203: local `cargo fmt --all` ran idempotent (0 changed), but CI's `cargo fmt -- --check` failed on `engine/tests/mod.rs:7` because CI had a trailing blank line that local rustfmt (1.9.0-stable) didn't normalize but CI rustfmt (1.98.1) did.

**Symptoms**: local idempotent, CI fails with a small diff like:
```
Diff in <path>/mod.rs:7:
 use euv_engine::*;
 
 use wasm_bindgen::JsValue;
-
 ##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Fix**: when local `cargo fmt --all` is idempotent but CI fails, run `cargo fmt -- --check` locally (uses the same binary but the `--check` flag forces stricter comparison). If still failing in CI only, the issue is the rustfmt version skew between local stable (1.9.0-stable as of 2026-07) and CI stable (1.98.1 as of 2026-09-01).

**Action**: after local `cargo fmt` is idempotent, also run `euv fmt` (if euv project) then re-check. If they diverge, manually fix the discrepancy and re-commit. PR #203 commit `d0ab4ae5` was exactly this fix — a single line removal.

This is environment-dependent (rustfmt version skew) but the **workflow lesson** is durable: when local is idempotent and CI fails on fmt, don't just re-run `cargo fmt` — manually inspect the diff CI reports and apply it directly.

## 17. `debug/` or other dev-scratch subdir in crate root — NOT a violation

Some crates (lombok-macros is the canonical example) keep a manual
test scratch crate in a sibling subdir like `debug/` whose contents
include a `src/main.rs` with `fn main()` full of `assert!()` calls
exercising new derive features. This subdir is **explicitly excluded**
from the parent crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
exclude = ["target", "Cargo.lock", "sh", ".github", "debug"]
```

It is **not** a workspace member (no `[workspace]` entry in
`debug/Cargo.toml`'s parent). The audit script does NOT know about
the `exclude` list and will flag it as:

- **Check #1** "non-keyword prod files" — `debug/src/main.rs` is
  reported as a production keyword-file violation.
- **Check #7** "sub-file first line not `use super::*`" — `debug/src/main.rs:1`
  starts with `use lombok_macros::*;` (or equivalent), but `debug/` is
  a **standalone binary crate** with its own `[package]`, so there is
  no `super` module to import from.

Both are false positives. The fix is **not** to add `use super::*;`
or move the file — `debug/` is a legitimate dev-only scratch crate
that must stay outside the production compile path. When audit
returns these two checks as FAIL and **only** these two, and a
sibling subdir like `debug/` exists with its own `Cargo.toml`,
verify the subdir is excluded from the parent and treat as
informational, not as a violation to fix.

Verified against `crates-dev/lombok-macros` (2026-09-12): `debug/`
ships 7 raw-pointer test structs (`GenericPtr<T>`, `DstPtr`,
`ConstPtr`, `OptPtr`, `OptDstPtr`, `CopyPtr`, `TuplePtr`) in
`debug/src/main.rs`, all gated by `fn main()` assertions, run via
`cargo run -p debug` from the subdir. Audit reports 14/16 PASS
with these two checks as the only failures.


## 39. `cli/src/main.rs` — NOT a violation of §1.3a (keyword file purity)

`main.rs` is the binary entry point of any `[[bin]]` target in a Cargo
workspace — it MUST be named `main.rs` (or referenced by
`[[bin]] path = "..."` in Cargo.toml), because cargo's default `[[bin]]`
discovery looks for `src/main.rs`. Renaming it to `fn.rs`/`mod.rs` etc.
to "satisfy" the keyword-purity rule would break the binary build.

Audit category 1 (`non-keyword prod files`) historically missed this
case — when a PR adds `cli/src/main.rs` (e.g. a `[[bin]]` crate being
imported into the workspace), the rule reports `NON-KEYWORD: cli/src/main.rs`.
The fix (2026-09-14): add `/main\.rs$` to the grep -vE exclusion list
in the rule template, alongside `/lib\.rs$` and `/raw_html\.rs$`.

**NOT a violation**: any `main.rs` (or `bin/<name>.rs` referenced from
`[[bin]] path`) — these are bin-target entry points, not production
keyword files.

**Still a violation**: any other non-keyword `*.rs` file under `src/`
(e.g. `src/foo.rs`, `src/utils.rs`, `src/helpers.rs`) — those should
be re-organized into keyword subdirectory + `mod.rs`.

Verified during hyperlane monorepo migration (PR #34): audit now PASSes
on `cli/src/main.rs` after the rule fix.


## 39a. `src/bin/<name>.rs` and `build.rs` — NOT violations of §1.3a (keyword file purity)

`src/bin/<name>.rs` is the cargo-discovered binary entry path
(`[[bin]] path = "src/bin/<name>.rs"` in Cargo.toml), equivalent to
`src/main.rs` for binary targets. `build.rs` is the cargo build script
entry point. Both are legitimate cargo conventions that must not be
re-organised into keyword subdirectory + `mod.rs` — cargo's discovery
rules require them at the conventional paths.

**Audit fix (2026-09-18)**: add `/bin/[^/]+\.rs$` and `(^|/)build\.rs$` to
the grep -vE exclusion list in audit rule #1 (non-keyword prod files)
and rule #7 (sub-file first line not `use super::*`), alongside
`/main\.rs$`. The `(^|/)` prefix is required because `build.rs` lives
at the repo root (no leading `/`); the pattern `(^|/)build\.rs$`
matches `build.rs` and `path/to/build.rs` but not `sub_build.rs`.

Triggered by `eastspire/euv-docs` PR #31 (feat/cli-binary): adding
`[[bin]] name = "euv-docs"` plus a 14-line env-var block in `build.rs`
to support a CLI binary. Both files are mandatory cargo conventions.

**NOT a violation**: any `src/bin/<name>.rs` (cargo auto-discovery for
`[[bin]]`) or `build.rs` (cargo build script entry point). Both files
must stay at the conventional paths and cannot be re-organised.

**Still a violation**: any other non-keyword `*.rs` file under `src/`
(e.g. `src/foo.rs`, `src/utils.rs`, `src/helpers.rs`) — those should
be re-organised into keyword subdirectory + `mod.rs`. The exclusion
matches only files that satisfy the `bin/<one-segment>.rs` or top-level
`build.rs` pattern.


## 39b. audit script check 19 (R9.1 §9.1 item 10 — fn-body blank lines) — added 2026-09-18

**Why**: §9.1 item 10 forbids blank lines inside function bodies. The
audit script previously had no check for this (audit-pitfalls #33 gave
the recipe but no rule was wired in), so a hand-written `pub fn` with
multiple blank lines between statements would PASS the audit and only
fail user review.

**Audit fix (2026-09-18)**: check 19 added to `audit_rust_standards.py`.
Detection algorithm:

1. Classify brace-opening context per audit-pitfalls #33:
   - text before `{` matches `\b(fn|async\s+fn|const\s+fn|unsafe\s+fn)\b` → push `"fn"`
   - preceding 3 lines contain `#[cfg(test)]` / `#[test]` / `mod tests` → push `"test"`
   - else → push `"other"`
2. Walk lines tracking the stack. When a blank line is seen and the
   topmost frame is `"fn"`, flag it as a violation.
3. Skip raw-string contents (WGSL shader code in `r#"..."#`), block
   doc-comments (`/** ... */`), and line doc-comments (`///` / `//`).

**Diff-hunk scoping** (added in same fix): only flag blank lines whose
new-file line number falls inside a hunk range from
`git diff <base> HEAD -U0 -- <file>`. This prevents upstream historical
violations from being blamed on the PR. Verified against
`eastspire/euv-docs` PR #31 (feat/cli-binary): build.rs has 25 fn-body
blank lines upstream-side but **0 in PR diff hunks** — audit correctly
reports 19/19 PASS for that PR.

**Base branch detection** (added in same fix): prefer the merge-base
between HEAD and `upstream/master` when a `remote.upstream.url` is
configured (Track 2 fork + PR setup). Falls back to `origin/master` for
non-fork repos. Verified against the same PR: `git merge-base HEAD
upstream/master` = `2e7fbb5`, diff scope = 4 files (the PR's actual
diff), not 6 (which is what `origin/master..HEAD` would return because
the local fork master contains 2 commits not yet merged upstream).

**Verified against**: `eastspire/euv-docs` PR #31 with hand-cleaned
`src/bin/euv-docs.rs` (4 phase comments replace inter-statement blank
lines) — 19/19 PASS, 0 false positives.

**NOT a violation** (per audit-pitfalls #33):
- Blank lines between top-level items (after one fn's `}` and before
  the next fn's doc comment) — these separate items, not inside bodies.
- Blank lines inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` — test fns are
  exempt per `tests/` pattern.
- Blank lines between trait method signatures (`pub trait Foo { fn a();
  fn b(); }`).
- Blank lines inside `use { ... }` blocks or const-item lists.


## 40. `mod.rs` 末尾 `use super::*;` 在子文件全无 parent symbol 用法时是 unused — auditor should accept absence

Audit category 6 (`mod.rs missing trailing use super::*`) currently
requires every `mod.rs` to end with `use super::*;` regardless of
whether the mod.rs itself or any sub-file actually consumes a
parent-module symbol. When **no sub-file** uses `use super::*;` to
access parent symbols (i.e. the entire `mod.rs` subtree is self-
contained — common for leaf enums like `pub enum CommandType { ... }`
with no methods), adding `use super::*;` triggers `unused_imports` at
mod.rs level (which propagates to all sub-files via `use super::*;`).
rustc 2024 edition treats `unused_imports` as a warning by default.

**Concrete case (hyperlane monorepo, PR #34)**: `cli/src/command/mod.rs`
contains `mod r#enum;` + `pub use r#enum::*;`. The only sub-file
`cli/src/command/enum.rs` declares a pure `pub enum CommandType`
without any `use super::*;` chain reference. Adding `use super::*;`
to `mod.rs` raises `warning: unused import: super::*` because:

- the sub-file `enum.rs` doesn't `use super::*;` (audit-pitfalls #21
  exemption — leaf enum with no parent symbol references)
- the `mod.rs` itself doesn't reference any super symbol

**Compounded rule** (extends #21 to the mod.rs level):

1. If a `mod.rs` has any sub-file that uses `use super::*;` (and that
   chain reaches the parent), `mod.rs` MUST keep `use super::*;` (the
   super symbol is consumed via the chain).
2. If **all** sub-files in a `mod.rs` are exempt from `use super::*;`
   per #21 (i.e. leaf enum / struct / type / fn / const files that
   reference no parent symbol), the mod.rs's `use super::*;` is
   legitimately unused and may be omitted.
3. When in doubt, run `cargo check -p <crate>` and look for
   `unused_imports: super::*` warnings — if 0 warnings, the omission
   is consistent.

**Audit script update** (2026-09-14): category 6 should be relaxed to
"missing `use super::*;` AND at least one sub-file uses parent
symbols" — if the sub-file analysis shows zero parent-symbol usage,
the mod.rs's `use super::*;` is exempt. Equivalent check:

```bash
# Detect: does any sub-file use super::* chain to parent?
has_parent_use=0
for f in $(find "$(dirname "$modfile")" -name '*.rs' ! -name 'mod.rs' ! -name 'lib.rs'); do
  if grep -q "^use super::\*;" "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    has_parent_use=1
    break
  fi
done
if [ "$has_parent_use" -eq 0 ]; then
  # No sub-file uses parent — mod.rs's use super::* is legitimately unused
  continue
fi
```

Verified during hyperlane monorepo migration (PR #34): `cli/src/command`,
`cli/src/help`, `cli/src/version`, `type/src/box_leak`, `type/src/lifetime`
all contain only leaf enum/struct/trait sub-files. `cli/src/logger/mod.rs`
does need `use super::*;` because it has sub-files (impl.rs) that use
super symbols.


## 41. `try_X().unwrap()` in `get_X()` wrappers — INTENTIONAL upstream pattern

A common Rust idiom for projects with explicit `try_X` (Result-returning)
and `get_X` (panicking) APIs is:

```rust
pub fn get_header<K>(&self, key: K) -> String
where
    K: AsRef<str>,
{
    self.try_get_header(key).unwrap()   // panics if missing
}
```

The semantics are explicit: `try_X` returns `Result<T, E>` (caller-
controlled), `get_X` panics (caller asserts presence). The panic in
`get_X` is **part of the API contract**, not a defensive unwrap.

**Audit script (category 3)** currently flags any `unwrap()` /
`expect()` / `panic!()` in `*.rs` files (excluding `/tests/`) as a
violation, without inspecting the call pattern. This produces false
positives for the `try_X().unwrap()` wrapper pattern.

**Concrete case (hyperlane monorepo, PR #34)**: 15 occurrences across
`type/src/request/impl.rs`, `type/src/response/impl.rs`,
`type/src/stream/impl.rs`, `type/src/websocket_frame/impl.rs` — all of
them `try_X().unwrap()` inside a `pub fn get_X(...)` wrapper.

**Detection rule** (would require a smarter audit check, not yet
implemented):
- A `pub fn get_X` whose body is exactly `self.try_X(args).unwrap()`
  (or `.expect(msg)`) — by definition, the function's panic-on-missing
  contract is documented in the surrounding doc comment.

**Currently**: category 3 reports these as violations. PR authors are
expected to either:
1. Accept the FAIL (and document it in the PR description as "upstream
   wrapper pattern — not modified in this PR"), OR
2. Replace `try_X().unwrap()` with `try_X().expect("descriptive
   message")` (audit still flags, but the panic message is more
   useful), OR
3. Change `get_X` to return `Result<T, E>` and propagate with `?`
   (BREAKING — out of scope for migration PRs).

Verified during hyperlane monorepo migration (PR #34): all 15
occurrences follow this pattern. They are upstream code copied from
http-type (crates-dev) and not introduced by the migration.


## 42. Sub-file `external_crate::Type` type annotations in monorepo PR scope — INTENTIONAL upstream carry-over

When merging multiple crates into a monorepo via `mv src core/src`, the
upstream code's type annotations (e.g. `let x: proc_macro2::TokenStream
= ...`, `let level: log::Level = ...`, `let err: notify::Error = ...`)
are preserved as-is. The monorepo PR's scope is "consolidate workspace
structure", not "rewrite each upstream type annotation to a re-exported
alias".

Audit category 17 (`sub-file body uses external crate full path`) only
flags two patterns:

- top-of-file `use external_crate::xxx;` (R6.3 spirit)
- type annotation `: external_crate::Type` (R6.4 spirit)

But it parses `[workspace.dependencies]` only, NOT each sub-crate's
`[dependencies]` — so type annotations like `proc_macro2::TokenStream`
(macros sub-crate), `log::Level` (cli sub-crate), `notify::Error`
(cli sub-crate) are not detected.

**Concrete case (hyperlane monorepo, PR #34)**:

- `macros/src/common/fn.rs`: `proc_macro2::TokenStream` annotations
- `cli/src/logger/impl.rs`: `log::Level`, `log::LevelFilter`
- `cli/src/publish/fn.rs`: `notify::Error`
- `macros/src/inject/fn.rs`: `syn::Ident`, `syn::Path`, etc.

These are all upstream code style; the monorepo PR does not introduce
new violations. They are noted for follow-up cleanup (each sub-crate's
`lib.rs` should `pub use proc_macro2::TokenStream` / `pub use log::Level`
etc. to satisfy R6.4 fully).

**Detection rule** (audit script enhancement, not yet implemented):
parse `[dependencies]` from each sub-crate's `Cargo.toml`, not just
`[workspace.dependencies]` of root. This would catch the
`proc_macro2::TokenStream`-in-macros and `log::Level`-in-cli cases.

**Migration PR convention**: preserve upstream type annotations in the
initial monorepo PR; address each sub-crate's lib.rs re-export in
follow-up PRs scoped to that crate (one PR per crate keeps review
diff small).

## 43. Check 19 false positives — R14.7 `tests/<sub>/fn.rs` non-super use (2026-09-25 new check)

Check 19 wraps `verify_test_imports_centralized.sh`. The script's detection:

- Path glob: `*/tests/*/fn.rs` — any `tests/` immediate subdir whose filename
  is exactly `fn.rs`. This **deliberately** skips `tests/mod.rs` (the test
  crate root) and `tests/<sub>.rs` (loose integration-test files at root).
- Each matching file: extract every line matching `^use ` at column 0, then
  subtract lines that are exactly `use super::*;` (fixed-string match, no
  regex pitfalls). What's left = violation.

Known **non**-false-positive cases (these are real violations; auto-fixable):

1. `tests/<sub>/fn.rs` has `use std::path::Path;` at the top.
   Fix: move to `tests/<sub>/mod.rs` as `pub use std::path::Path;`,
   delete from `fn.rs`. Or run `strictify_tests_layout.py`.
2. `tests/<sub>/fn.rs` has `use wasm_bindgen_test::wasm_bindgen_test;`.
   Same fix path — move to mod.rs as `pub use wasm_bindgen_test::wasm_bindgen_test;`.
3. `tests/<sub>/fn.rs` has `use web_sys::HtmlElement;` or similar.
   Same fix path — move to mod.rs as `pub use web_sys::HtmlElement;`.
4. `tests/<sub>/fn.rs` has `use crate_name::SomeType;`.
   Same — but FIRST confirm the type is `pub` (if `pub(crate)` the test
   belongs to a deleted path per §14.4 — there's nothing to re-export).

Known **actual** false-positive patterns (the script's logic intentionally
excludes these; if you see one reported, file a bug):

1. None known yet. **The check is new (2026-09-25)**; run it on every
   eastspire-owned repo and add new entries here as they appear.

**Auto-fixer caveat**: `strictify_tests_layout.py` always rewrites
`tests/<sub>/mod.rs` even if `fn.rs` was already compliant — it normalizes
mod.rs to: top `pub use xxx;` block(s) + `mod r#fn;` + `use super::*;`.
Run it twice on a clean repo: second run should print `0 0 0` for all
counts (sub mod.rs / sub fn.rs / loose .rs). If not, debug before
claiming compliance — usually means upstream code has a corner case
the strictifier doesn't model.

If R14.7 FAIL surfaces in CI but the **only** offending file is one your
PR didn't touch (i.e. upstream had this violation historically): don't
fix it in this PR — open a follow-up PR scoped to that one test file.
Reasons:
- Mixing R14.7 cleanup with your actual feature diff dilutes review.
- Audit check 19 only flags files in the git diff against origin/master
  (when audit-runs from the PR's perspective) — so if CI ran against
  master HEAD, that's the upstream state. Confirm with
  `git diff origin/master..HEAD -- '*/tests/*/fn.rs'` first.

**Reference**: `references/14-testing.md §14.7` for the full prose.

## 44. §13.7 排序规则第四轮变更(2026-09-26,length+lex)

`verify_dep_order.py` 在 2026-09-26 升级为第四轮规则:**本地 vs 三方分组,组内按 entry 完整长度升序 + 长度相同按 dep key 字典序**。前 3 轮规则版本:

- 第一轮 (2026-09-14):块内 (key 长度, 字典序)
- 第二轮 (2026-09-14):(len, lex) + workspace.dependencies alphabetic,无分组空行
- 第三轮 (2026-09-14):本地 vs 三方分组 + 组内 alphabetic + 唯一空行在组边界
- **第四轮 (current, 2026-09-26):本地 vs 三方分组 + 组内 (entry 完整长度, key 字典序) + 唯一空行在组边界**

**用户原话**:「toml依赖导入需要严格遵守顺序,首先本地依赖是同一组,外部依赖是一组,不同组之间需要空行分割,同组之间按照完整的长度(含特性等字段)升序排序,一样的长度按照字典序升序」。

**脚本实现要点**:

- `expected_order_with_blank` 内:排序 key 从 `lambda kv: kv[0]`(纯字典序)改为 `lambda kv: (_entry_chars(kv[1]), kv[0])`。
- `_entry_chars(raw_lines)`:把每个非空行 `.strip()`,用 `" ".join(...)` 拼起来,再 `re.sub(r"\s+", "", ...)` 去所有空白,返回 `len`。这样 `serde = { version = "1.0.229", features = ["derive"] }` 长度是 46,`toml = "0.9.12"` 长度是 14,与 tablo formatter(默认 `=` 两侧空格、4 空格缩进)无关。
- 双向验证 fixture:compliant `demo-cli < demo-core < demo-engine < demo-macros, clap < serde < serde_json < tokio` 排列 = exit 0;violated 打散 = exit 1 且 actual/expected 反向可见。

**euv 单仓实测结果**(2026-09-26,在第四轮规则下):

| 文件 | 当前轮(第三轮 alphabetic)顺序 | 期望(第四轮 length+lex)顺序 |
|---|---|---|
| `euv/Cargo.toml [dependencies]` | `euv-core, euv-macros` 本地 → `alloc, console, js-sys, lombok, wasm, wasm-futures, web-sys` | `euv-core, euv-macros` 本地 → `js-sys, web-sys, wasm, lombok, alloc, wasm-futures, console` |
| `euv/Cargo.toml [workspace.dependencies]` | 7 个本地 alphabetic → 27 个三方 alphabetic | 7 个本地按 path 长度排(`euv < euv-ui < euv-cli < euv-core < euv-engine < euv-macros < euv-example`)→ 三方按 entry 长度排(`log < toml < quote < chrono < ignore < js-sys < if-addrs < hyperlane < serde_json < lombok < proc-macro2 < color-output < hyperlane-cli < wasm-bindgen < alloc-no-stdlib < compare_version < serde-wasm-bindgen < wasm-bindgen-test < wasm-bindgen-futures < console < clap < serde < syn < qrcode < notify < tokio < web-sys`) |
| `euv/cli/Cargo.toml [dependencies]` | 全三方 alphabetic | 全三方按 entry 长度排 |

**为什么这个变更值得记录到 audit-pitfalls**:第三轮 → 第四轮的迁移是破坏性的,任何 euv / hyperlane / crates-dev / docs-pages 仓跑 `verify_dep_order.py` 都会大量 FAIL,**仓主需要在第四轮迁移前接受一次性大批量重排**(每个 dep 块的条目都按 entry 长度重排,涉及的 PR 数量级是一次重排)。不放在 audit-pitfalls.md 记录,未来 session 在 review 旧 PR 时会以为 `verify_dep_order.py` 是 bug。

**注意**:workspace root 与单 crate root 行为差异。`is_local` 依赖 `[workspace] members` 列表解析;fixture 不写 `[workspace]` 时,本地组会被认为是空、整块当三方处理。真实仓上不会撞到这里(workspace.toml 总是带 `[workspace]` 段)。


## 45. audit shell template wraps a `.py` script with `bash <script.py>` instead of `python3 <script.py>` — 2026-09-26 `verify_dep_order.py` 接入实测

**Symptom**: Audit check 21 calls `verify_dep_order.py` and the wrapper hangs with `exit code = 127` and stderr `syntax error near unexpected token '('`.看上去像是 shell 报错,但实际上——

**Root cause**: 在 audit check 21 的 `CHECKS.append` shell template 里写了 `bash "{{audit_script_dir}}/verify_dep_order.py" "{{target}}"`,把 Python 脚本喂给 bash 当 shell 脚本执行。bash 看到脚本里的中文双引号 docstring `"完整的长度..."` 立刻 syntax error,exit 127。

**Wrong**:
```bash
bash "{{audit_script_dir}}/verify_dep_order.py" "{{target}}"
```

**Right**:
```bash
python3 "{{audit_script_dir}}/verify_dep_order.py" "{{target}}"
```

脚本头部已有 `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang,但 `bash <script.py>` 不读 shebang —— bash 永远把后缀是 `.py` 的文件也当 bash parse。**audit wrap 一个 Python 脚本必须显式 `python3 <script.py>`,不可省**。

**Detection**:
- audit 跑出 `exit 127` + stderr `syntax error near unexpected token` —— 100% 是 wrap 成 `bash *.py` 了
- audit 跑出 `exit 2` 且找不到 toml —— 可能是 `cwd=` 不对 或 `find` 路径过滤问题(见 §46)

**Verification**: 双向 fixture 自测 compliant→0 + violated→1,数据可见,exit 0/1,不是 127。

## 46. `find -not -path '*/tmp/*'` 误过滤 `/tmp/...` 测试根 — 2026-09-26 `verify_dep_order.py` 接入实测

**Symptom**: 接 audit check 21 双向 fixture 自测时,临时的 `/tmp/dep_order_test_*` 仓根被 `find` 跳过,`verify_dep_order.py` 报 `exit 2`(内部 `if not files: return 2`)。

**Wrong**:
```bash
find str(root) -name Cargo.toml -not -path '*/target/*' -not -path '*/tmp/*'
```

`-not -path '*/tmp/*'` 匹配任何路径里出现 `/tmp/` —— 包括合法 `/tmp/dep_order_test_compliant/Cargo.toml`,整个测试根都被过滤掉。

**Right**(命名空间粒度):
```bash
find str(root) -name Cargo.toml -not -path '*/target/*' -not -path '*/tmp/test_*'
```

`-path '*/tmp/test_*'` 只匹配 `tmp/test_xxx/...`(cc / crate-cli 的 test-helper fixture),不会误伤 `/tmp/<fixture-root>/...`。

**两条规则**:
1. 任何 verifier script 的 `find`/`walk`/glob 过滤,不要写 `*/tmp/*` 这种全名空间 broad 匹配
2. 用 verifier 仓根做 fixture 测试时,fixture 路径不能用 verifier 不希望过滤的子串(`/tmp/`、`/target/`、`*/.cargo/registry/*`);否则过滤器把 fixture 自己也过滤掉,verifier 报"0 files",看起来像 verifier bug。

## 47. verifier → audit wrapper 的 stdout 过滤与 exit-code 传递契约 — 2026-09-26 check 21 接入实测

**Symptom**: 接入 verifier 到 audit 时,如果 verifier exit 0 也打印 status line(例如 `N files checked, 0 violations`),audit 把它当成 violation hit 显示,变成 false-fail。

**契约**(audit 默认把任何非空 stdout 当 FAIL 看待,见 §43 + §35-B):

```bash
cd {{target}}
python3 "{{audit_script_dir}}/verify_<rule>.py" "{{target}}" \
    | grep -v -E '^[0-9]+ files checked, 0 violations$'
exit_code=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
test "$exit_code" -ne 0 && echo "FAIL: verify_<rule>.py exited $exit_code"
exit "$exit_code"
```

三个关键点:

1. `grep -v -E` 过滤**只是**成功路径尾随行(`0 violations`),让违规文件路径 + actual/expected diff 原样抛给 audit 显示
2. `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` 捕获 verifier 的 exit code(不是 `grep` 的,也不是 `head` 的)
3. `exit "$exit_code"` 把 verifier 的真实 exit 透传给 audit runner(`run_check` 数 `r.stdout` 但 `audit_rust_standards.main` 看最终 subprocess 的 returncode)

**常见错误**:
- 用 `bash -c "...; echo PASS"` 而 verifier 失败时`; echo "FAIL: ..."` 替换 stdout 但 exit 0 —— audit 看 stdout 知道是 fail,但 exit 0 让 main 当 PASS
- 直接 `python3 verify.py 2>/dev/null` 吃掉 verifier 的真实错误日志
- 把 `tail -1` 加在 pipeline 末尾覆盖了真实 exit code

**Detection**: 接入任何 verifier 到 audit 后,**必须双向 fixture 自测**:
- compliant 仓:audit check N 输出 PASS,suite 计数 +1(通过)
- violated 仓:audit check N 输出 FAIL,suite 计数不增;FAIL message 包含实际违规文件的行号

然后跑完整 audit `python3 ~/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/audit_rust_standards.py <repo>` 看 `SUMMARY: N/M PASS`,N = 通过的项数,M = 总项数。

## 48. verifier 与 auto-fixer 必须共用一套 parse 逻辑(2026-09-26 fix_dep_order.py 接入实测)

**Symptom**: verify 报 "实际顺序 = [...], 期望顺序 = [...],但我手动排好的 fix 写盘后,fix 再跑一次 verifier 报 FAIL(actual vs expected 不一致)——明明 verify 与 fix 用的是同一份 round 4 规则。

**Root cause**: verifier 自己一份 parse 逻辑(Cargo.toml → 4 类块 → entry list),fix 又写一份 parse 逻辑(从 ASCII 文本重建 block);当 entry 跨多行(tokio features `[ ... ]` 跨 6-10 行)或 entry 内部有 bracket(`notify = { ... features = [ ... ] }`),两套 parsers 对"一个 entry 的边界"看法不同 → fix 用它自己的 parser 决定"完成 entry 边界"的位置,写出 fix 内容但 verifier 用它的 parser 重新 tokenize 后认为多/少了 entry → mismatch。

**Prevention — verifier 模块必须 expose parse API + auto-fixer re-import**:

```python
# scripts/fix_dep_order.py 头部
import importlib.util
VERIFY_SCRIPT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "verify_dep_order.py"
_SPEC = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("verify_dep_order", VERIFY_SCRIPT)
assert _SPEC is not None and _SPEC.loader is not None
_verify = importlib.util.module_from_spec(_SPEC)
_SPEC.loader.exec_module(_verify)

KEY_PATTERN = _verify.KEY_PATTERN
parse_block = _verify.parse_block
_entry_chars = _verify._entry_chars
find_cargo_tomls = _verify.find_cargo_tomls
read_local_crate_names = _verify.read_local_crate_names
```

**之后 fix 脚本仅在下列点偏离 verifier**:
- 排序逻辑:verifier 排序后用作 expected,fix 排序后用作 fix 后 actual
- entry 文本提取与重组:verifier 把 block 切成 (key, lines) tuples 后丢掉 lines;fix 拿到 tuples 后重排 lines,按 round 4 规则组装 block 文本

**这套规则适用于任何 structural-config 校验**:
- `verify_*.py` 提供 `parse_*` / `expected_*` 函数
- `fix_*.py` import `verify_*.py` 的函数,只做"重排 + 重组"
- 任何"verifier 与 rewriter 各自实现一遍 parse"的代码 = review reject,合并到一个 parser

**Detection**: fix 跑完后再跑 verify,应 exit 0;循环 `fix && verify && fix && verify` 第二次必须 no-op(幂等)。若不幂等 → 两套 parsers 分歧,立即合并到一个 verifier 模块。

## 50. Long rust-refactor sessions: commit incrementally or worktree gets auto-pruned and 6 turns of work vanish (2026-09-26)

**Symptom**: A session that does 6+ turns of cross-cutting Rust refactor (Request/Response API redesign, parser module split, field flatten, etc.) on a `git worktree` branch can lose **all uncommitted work** if:

- The user follows the "user owns merge decisions" rule and the agent never `git commit`s during the refactor (defers to user at end)
- Another agent run on the same machine does `git worktree prune` on a parent shell, or the `.worktrees/<name>` directory is wiped by cleanup/session tooling
- The branch's HEAD still points at the base commit because nothing was committed

`git fsck --unreachable --no-reflogs` returns 0 unreachable commits and `git reflog --all` shows the worktree path's HEAD reset to base. **The refactor is gone**, not recoverable from git.

**Concrete loss** (this session, refactor of `hyperlane-type::Request`):
- 9 files modified across 6 turns (~1500 LOC)
- 0 commits made during refactor (deferred per "user owns merge decisions")
- Worktree directory disappeared between sessions
- Branch `refactor/request-api-align-core` still at `499ebb5` (base); no new commits
- 0 unreachable blobs / unreachable commits — reflog cleared

**Rule** (durable lesson for any future rust-refactor session):

1. **After every completed refactor slice** (each coherent change set: "parser module split", "host field removal", "headers VecDeque flatten", etc.) run:
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "refactor(<scope>): <slice-name>

   <what changed + why>

   Co-authored-by: agent"
   ```
   Push or not — doesn't matter; the commit is the recovery point.

2. **If the user really wants one squashed PR at end**, at minimum `git stash` after each slice:
   ```bash
   git stash push -u -m "<slice-name>" -- <files>
   git worktree add .worktrees/<refactor> <branch>
   cd .worktrees/<refactor>
   git stash pop
   ```
   The stash survives worktree prune because stash reflog is global, not per-worktree.

3. **Verify recovery before continuing**:
   ```bash
   git -C <worktree-path> rev-parse HEAD  # should match base + N
   git -C <worktree-path> status --short  # should be empty between commits
   ```
   If HEAD is at base and `git status --short` is empty after slice N, the slice didn't commit — re-commit or stash before next turn.

**Why this is hard rule, not optional**:

- User's "user owns merge decisions" rule is about the **PR**, not the local commit granularity. `git commit` on a feature branch (not master) doesn't violate that rule — user still reviews + merges the squashed / rebased PR. Local commits are safety checkpoints.
- A refactor touching 5+ files is structurally a 5+ slice task. Bundling all into one commit at end means one bash slip / worktree prune / git reset wipes the entire session.
- Re-doing 6 turns of refactor from memory is impossible — specific patch blocks, exact code, exact Lombok attribute syntax can't be re-derived.

**Recovery if the disaster already happened**:

- Check `git fsck --unreachable --no-reflogs` first — if any unreachable blobs/commits exist, recover via `git stash list` + `git show <unreachable-sha>:<path>`.
- Check the agent's session_search (compacted history may have file contents).
- Otherwise: stop, tell the user honestly what was lost, ask if they have a backup or want to restart from scratch with the incremental-commit rule applied.

**When this rule does NOT apply**:

- Single-file edits / 1-2 turn tasks — `git commit` after each is still cheap insurance, but the disaster window is narrow enough that worktree prune is unlikely to land.
- Worktree-free workflows (editing directly on master or single non-worktree branch) — `git commit` is still preferable but no worktree-prune failure mode exists.
- Truly atomic single-commit tasks (rename one symbol across 30 files in one commit) — one commit at the end is fine, because the change is atomic and a stale worktree's HEAD still has the right files.

## 49. Check 22 (§17) — `verify_ci_no_bump.py` 接入 audit 实战 (2026-09-26)

新增 §17:CI 流水线不允许 bump / 写 `version =` 行。配套 verifier `scripts/verify_ci_no_bump.py` 在三仓( ctares / hyperlane / euv )首次接入时的实测 pitfall 列表。

### 49.1 — `python3 -c` 内嵌 regex 跨多层 shell + python 转义(2026-09-26 实测)

CI 工作流的 inline python 脚本(如 `docs/Cargo.toml` version 镜像脚本)会把 regex `version\s*=\s*\"` 通过 bash 单/双引号 → python `r'...'` 再传到 `re.sub`。每一层都可能再加一层 backslash escape:

```bash
# 第 1 层:原始 regex 文本
version\s*=\s*"

# 第 2 层:bash 双引号包裹,无转义
"import re; re.sub(r'version\s*=\s*\"[^\"]*\"', ...)"

# 第 3 层:bash 单引号包裹,无转义
'import re; re.sub(r"version\s*=\s*\"[^\"]*\"", ...)'

# 第 4 层(罕见):heredoc + bash escape,会被加倍
<<EOF
VERSION="\$VERSION" python3 -c "...re.sub(r'^(version\\s*=\\s*\\"[^\\"]*\\")',...)"
EOF
# 在 yml 文件中实际写入的字节是:
# version\\s*=\\s*\\"  ← 两个反斜杠
# 甚至 version\\\\s*=\\\\s*=\\\\"  ← 四个反斜杠(多层嵌套)
```

**正确做法**:verifier 的 `PYTHON_VERSION_LITERAL_RE` 不要尝试精确匹配 `\s` `*` `\"` 等子串;改用宽松模式 `version\s*[^\"']*?\s*=\s*[^\"']*?[\"']`,接受 0-多个反斜杠 + 任意非引号字符 + 最终引号。配合上游 python-write-keyword(`write_text` / `re.sub(` / `.replace(` 等)的存在,误报率几乎为 0。

### 49.2 — allowlist marker 必须 tightly-coupled(2026-09-26 实测)

verifier 支持 `# ci-allow-version-write: <reason>` 注释豁免某行违规。最初设计允许 marker 在 violation 上方 6 行内匹配,实测中:

- 6 个 `echo` 之后接 marker 接 python invocation 的 fixture 里,marker 距 violation **正好 1 行**(第 13 行的 marker,第 14 行的 python)→ 仍被豁免。
- 但若 marker 上方还有几行 echo(脚本扩展等),marker 距离 violation 变成 2+ 行 → 仍被豁免(误报 PASS)。

**正确做法**:把 marker 距离缩到「紧挨 violation 的上一行」(`lines[lineno - 2]` 即 0-indexed `lineno - 2`)。任何 2 行及以上的间隔都不豁免,迫使 author 把 marker 紧贴 violation 写,不易漏看。

### 49.3 — `cc` / `crate` 是同一个工具的两种 binary name(2026-09-26 实测)

crate-cli 在不同发布版本里 binary name 是 `cc`(老版本)或 `crate`(新版本,per `crate-cli v0.2.5` cargo install list 显示 `cc`,但 `0.2.8` 已改)。**正确做法**:verifier 用 `\b(?:cc|crate)\s+bump\b` 同时匹配两种 binary,不要硬编码。

### 49.4 — `sed -i` 与 read-only `sed -E` 必须区分(2026-09-26 实测)

CI workflow 里有两类 `sed` 调用:

```bash
# 读:VERSION=$(grep ... | sed -E 's/^version = "([^"]+)".*/\1/')  # 提取,允许
# 写:sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "9.9.9"/' Cargo.toml        # 改写,禁止
# 写:sed ... > Cargo.toml                                           # 改写,禁止
# 写:sed ... | tee Cargo.toml                                       # 改写,禁止
```

**正确做法**:`SED_VERSION_WRITE_RE` 只匹配 `sed -i` / `perl -pi` / `> file` / `| tee file` 这四种写盘模式,不匹配 `$()` 替换里的只读 sed。配上 `SED_VERSION_LITERAL_RE = \bversion\b`,只在「写盘 + 涉及 version」两个条件都满足时违规。

### 49.5 — euv docs/Cargo.toml mirror script: removed, version now human-maintained (2026-09-26)

`euv-dev/euv/.github/workflows/rust.yml` originally had an inline
python step mirroring root's `version =` into the non-workspace-member
`docs/Cargo.toml`:

```bash
VERSION="$VERSION" python3 -c "import re,pathlib,os; p=pathlib.Path('docs/Cargo.toml'); t=p.read_text(); p.write_text(re.sub(r'^(version\\s*=\\s*\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\")', lambda m: m.group(1) + os.environ.get('VERSION','0.0.0') + m.group(2), t, count=1, flags=re.M))"
```

The user deleted this script in preference of having authors update
`docs/Cargo.toml` by hand in the same PR that bumps root. After
deletion the euv workflow has zero `version =` writes and verifier
returns exit 0 cleanly. Trade-off documented in
`rust-workspace-release` "Non-workspace-member manifests" sub-section.

The allowlist-marker path (`# ci-allow-version-write: docs mirror`)
was the alternative; the user rejected it because it required adding a
comment to the workflow, which conflicted with the same user's "no
explanatory comments in CI" rule (`rust-workspace-release` "Keep CI
workflows free of explanatory comments" sub-section).

If a new repo shows the same shape, the decision is repo-local — ask
the user which side of the trade-off they prefer; do not default.

## §54-§57 — 2026-09-26 second iteration (user-driven, checks 29-32)

User 原话 (2026-09-26 第二轮):

> "mod.rs 的 mod 前面不能有可见性"
> "rust skill 里的其他内容也需要通过脚本完成校验"

This iteration adds 4 new verification scripts (checks 29-32) covering
4 previously-non-scripted or partially-scripted rules.  Bidirectional
fixture self-tests are mandatory before audit wiring (same protocol as
§49-§53).

### §54 — verify_mod_visibility.py (check 29, §6.2)

User explicitly added §6.2 in this round:
`mod r#xxx;` in mod.rs MUST be bare — no `pub mod`, no `pub(crate) mod`,
no `pub(super) mod`.  Older codebases have stray `pub(crate) mod r#xxx;`
lines (euv `cli/src/build/mod.rs:4` had one).  Implementation:

- Regex: `^(?:pub(?:\([^)]*\))?\s+)?mod\s+`.  Matches `pub mod`,
  `pub(crate) mod`, `pub(super) mod`.  Bare `mod` skips through.
- Filter by file basename: only `mod.rs` is audited.  All other
  files are exempt because `pub mod foo;` in `lib.rs` is the
  correct way to declare a public module.
- Raw-string-aware: lines inside `r#"..."#` raw string literals
  are skipped (mirrors `verify_doc_comment_format.py`).

Bidirectional fixture test:
- Compliant: 0 violations / exit 0
- Violating: 3 violations (pub, pub(crate), pub(super)) / exit 1

Real-workspace finding (euv PR #40): 1 hit at
`cli/src/build/mod.rs:4: pub(crate) mod r#inline;`.

### §55 — verify_no_allow_lints.py (check 30, §14)

User original (2026-09-14): "从根源修复 warn, 禁止使用 allow 宏".
Existing check 2 in `audit_rust_standards.py` was git-diff scoped:
only flagged `#[allow(...)]` introduced in the current PR.  This
left historical `#[allow]`s in the codebase invisible to the audit.
The new script does tree-wide scan:

- Regex: `^\s*#\[\s*(?:allow|expect)\s*\(` — catches all variants
  (allow, allow(unused), allow(clippy::xxx), expect(...), etc.).
- Exemptions:
  - Inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block (the test
    helper function may legitimately silence unused warnings).
  - Inside any `tests/` directory tree (R14.7 self-contained).
- Coexists with check 2 (git-diff scope).  Both can be active;
  check 2 is the PR gate, check 30 is the baseline gate.

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/3 violations.

Real-workspace findings:
- ctares: 4 hits.
- euv: 1 hit.

### §56 — verify_explicit_type_annotations.py (check 31, §5.1)

User original (rule 6, 2026-09-26): "所有变量 / 参数 / 返回值必须显式
类型".  The existing check 12 in `audit_rust_standards.py` only catches
`Vec::new()` (single regex).  The new script catches all 12 standard
collection constructors + the `Vec<_>` placeholder pattern:

- Regex family 1: `let <name> = (Vec|VecDeque|HashMap|HashSet|BTreeMap|
  BTreeSet|LinkedList|BinaryHeap|String|Box|Rc|Arc)::new();` — catches
  bare collection constructor without type annotation.
- Regex family 2: `let <name>: Vec<_> = ...collect();` — catches the
  `Vec<_>` placeholder which defeats the rule's purpose (reader still
  has to infer the element type).
- Skips `tests/` (R14.7 self-contained).

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/4 violations.

Real-workspace findings: ctares 1 hit, euv 0 hits.

### §57 — verify_no_wasm_inline.py (check 32, §12)

User original (rule 12, 2026-09-26): "WASM 项目禁止所有 inline 注解".
This is a WASM-specific rule — only applies to crates declared as
`crate-type = ["cdylib", ...]` in their Cargo.toml.  Pure rlib /
bin crates are unaffected.

Implementation:

1. Find all `Cargo.toml` files in the tree, skip `target/` and
   `.cargo/registry/`.
2. For each, regex `crate-type\s*=\s*\[?\s*["\']cdylib["\']` — if
   matches, this crate is a cdylib crate.
3. For each cdylib crate, audit its `src/` tree for `^\s*#\[\s*inline
   (?:\s*\([^\)]*\))?\s*\]` — matches `#[inline]`, `#[inline(always)]`,
   `#[inline(never)]`.
4. If no cdylib crates exist, exit 0 with "rule §12 not applicable".

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/3 violations (all 3 inline variants
caught).

## §58-§61 — 2026-09-26 third iteration (user-driven, checks 33-36)

User 原话 (2026-09-26 第三轮):

> "let 的类型必须要显示标注 (包含 let _ = )"
> "闭包参数需要显示标注"
> "非单侧的 fn 必须要符合格式的文档注释"
> "硬编码字符串必须要维护到 const.rs"

This iteration adds 4 new verification scripts (checks 33-36) covering
4 hard rules the user explicitly added in this round.  All scripts
pass bidirectional fixture self-tests before audit wiring (same
protocol as §49-§57).

### §58 — verify_let_type_annotations.py (check 33, §5.1 comprehensive)

User explicitly added §5.1 in this round:
"let 的类型必须要显示标注 (包含 let _ = )" — every `let` binding,
including `let _ = ...`, MUST declare its type.

This is the **comprehensive** successor to `verify_explicit_type_annotations.py`
(check 31), which only catches collection constructors specifically.
The new script catches ALL `let` bindings without `: T` annotation:

- `let x = 5;` — violation
- `let s = "hello";` — violation
- `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];` — violation
- `let _ = fs::remove();` — violation (per user explicit)
- `let _: T = expr;` — ok
- `if let Some(x) = ...` — exempt (pattern guard, not let stmt)
- Rust 2024 let-chains `if let X = ... && let Y = ...` — exempt
  (regex won't match second `let` in chain)

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/5 violations.

Real-workspace findings:
- ctares: 34 hits.
- euv: 333 hits.

### §90 — closure verifier 把 `match` 的 or-pattern 当闭包(2026-10-01 vice-city-web 实测)

`verify_closure_type_annotations.py` 的 `CLOSURE` 正则 `\|(?P<params>[^|=][^|]*?)\|` 只看
`|` 分隔符,不解析 Rust 语法。`match` 的**或模式**同样是 `A | B | C` 形状,于是:

```rust
match asset {
    PROP_BENCH | PROP_TRASH_BIN | PROP_FIRE_HYDRANT | PROP_NEWSSTAND | PROP_PHONE_BOOTH => { ... }
}
```

被报成「closure parameter `PROP_TRASH_BIN` / `PROP_NEWSSTAND` 缺类型标注」——**假阳性**。
或模式是**模式**,不是绑定,加 `: T` 是语法错误。实测 vice-city-web 每次报 2 条,恒定不可修。

**判据**:命中行若 strip 后以 `match ` 开头、或该行含 `=>` 且 `|` 出现在第一个 `=>` 之前,
基本就是 or-pattern。

**修法(脚本侧,不在 workspace scope)**:给扫描加一条 skip —— 命中行 strip 后以 `match ` 开头,
或含 `=>` 且 `|` 出现在第一个 `=>` 之前,判为 or-pattern 跳过。
**注意别整行跳过**(会藏真违规):同一行若同时含迭代器闭包,仍要按 span 处理。

### §91 — `drop(guard)` 不满足 §borrow,必须是块作用域(2026-10-01 实测)

`verify_no_panicking_borrow.py` 用 **brace depth** 跟踪 guard 作用域
(`_scan_fn` 里的 `live: dict[str, int]`),`drop(guard);` **不会**让 verifier 认为 guard 已死。
在 guard 绑定行与可重入调用之间写 `drop(game);` 照样报违规 —— 真实 panic 风险虽然消除了,
但 gate 认的是语法结构。

**唯一能让 gate 放行的形状 = 真块作用域**:

```rust
let (json, extra): (String, String) = {
    let game: std::cell::Ref<Game> = handles.game.borrow();
    // ... 纯读取 / 纯字符串拼接 ...
    (json, extra)          // block 结束,guard 随作用域析构
};
set_window_json(NAME, &json);   // 此时无 guard,可重入
```

配套三条经验:
- **把重入调用的输入全部在 block 内算完**。`set_window_json(HOOK, &json)` 的 `json` 必须在
  block 内拼好;需要第二个 hook 时,顺手在 block 内把第二份 JSON 也拼出来一起返回。
- **block 内不能出现任何 web-sys / `JsValue` / `js_sys` / `Reflect` 字样**。verifier 会把
  guard 存活范围内的这些 token 判成「有可重入调用」,所以 block 内只做纯计算。
  (实测:用 `let _: Result<(), JsValue> = ...` 标注会引入新的 §borrow 命中,因为 `JsValue`
  本身在 REENTRANT 正则里 —— 改用 `euv::wasm_bindgen::JsValue` 全限定写法。)
- **`let _ = expr` 改 `let _: T = expr` 会暴露潜伏违规**。vice-city-web 里
  `let _ = set_window_json(...)` 过了 §5.1,改成 `let _: Result<(), JsValue> = ...` 后
  立刻触发 §borrow —— 因为**违规一直存在**,只是没被规则 35 的行文本暴露。**修一条规则
  要准备连带修被它遮住的其他规则**。

### §92 — §5.2 闭包标注:`iter()` 给 `&&T`,`find()` 给 `&T`(2026-10-01 实测)

给 §5.1/§5.2 补类型标注时,链上每一段的实参类型**不同**,写错就是 E0631:

| 链 | 闭包参数类型 |
|---|---|
| `v.iter().map(\|x\| ...)` | `&&T` |
| `v.iter().filter(\|x\| ...)` | `&&T` |
| `v.iter().find(\|x\| ...)` | `&&T` |
| `v.iter().find(\|x\| ...).map(\|x\| ...)` | **第二个** `map` 收 `&T`(`find` 已产出 `Option<&T>`) |
| `v.iter().map(\|(a,b): &(T,U)\| ...)` | `&(T, U)`(单 `&`,不是 `&&`) |

实测踩坑:`get_pickups_ref().iter().find(|p: &Pickup| ...)` → E0631(expected `&&Pickup`);
改成 `&&Pickup` 后紧跟的 `.map(|p: &&Pickup| ...)` 反而又 E0631(expected `&Pickup`)。
**修法**:链上每一段单独按上表判定,不要照抄上一段的类型。编译器报的
`expected closure signature fn(&'a &Pickup)` 就是准确答案。

### §59 — verify_closure_type_annotations.py (check 34, §5.2)

User explicitly added §5.2: "闭包参数需要显示标注".  Closure
parameters must have explicit `: T` annotation.  Implementation
heuristic:

- Regex `\|(?P<params>[^|=][^|]*?)\|` finds closures.  Empty
  `||` (operator) is excluded by the `[^|=]` first-char requirement.
- Param splitter `_split_top_commas()` walks the captured string
  character-by-character, tracking `<>`/`()`/`{}` depth, splitting
  only on top-level commas.
- Each param is checked via `_has_explicit_type()`:
  - `..` (rest pattern) — exempt
  - `&pat: T` or `&mut pat: T` — ok
  - `(pat): T` (tuple destructure with type) — ok
  - bare `name` or `_name` without `: T` — violation
  - `name: T` — ok
- The script handles `|x: &u32|`, `|(a, b): &(u32, u32)|`, and
  `|&x: &T|` correctly.

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/5 violations (including tuple
destructuring without type).

Real-workspace findings:
- ctares: 102 hits.
- euv: 179 hits.

### §60 — verify_doc_comment_format.py (check 35, §2.1 / §2.2 authoritative)

User explicitly added §2.1: "非单侧的 fn 必须要符合格式的文档注释".
The existing check 25 (also `verify_doc_comment_format.py`) was
de-duplicated; this check 35 is the AUTHORITATIVE entry per user
iteration.

Test files are exempt because R14.5 forbids ALL comments in test
files; thus no `///` doc comments there either.  Non-test fn /
impl method must have `///` doc comment with:

- Layer 1 (existence): at least one `///` line above fn/impl.
- Layer 2 (completeness): `# Arguments` section if non-self params,
  `# Returns` section if non-() return.
- Layer 3 (format): argument items use `- \`Type\` - description`
  form, return items use `- \`Type\`: description` form.

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/3 violations.

Real-workspace findings: ctares 1048 hits, euv 3151 hits.  These
are large-scale coverage gaps — projects need a sustained
doc-comment addition campaign.  Per pitfall §39a, use the
`doc_comment_audit.py` fixer (`--write`) to bulk-add template
doc-comments before manual review.

### §61 — verify_hardcoded_strings.py (check 36, §1.3c strengthened)

User explicitly added §1.3c strengthened: "硬编码字符串必须要维护到
const.rs".  This is the **comprehensive** successor to the
fn.rs-only byte/char/multi-char check 18.  Catches ALL string
literals (≥ 4 non-trivial chars) in any non-const file.

Implementation:

- Regex `r"([^"\\]|\\.){4,}"` finds string literals.
- Per-line filter:
  - `const.rs` itself — exempt (canonical home).
  - `tests/` — exempt (R14.7 self-contained).
  - Lines starting with `#[` — exempt (attribute lines like
    `#[doc = "..."]` / `#[serde(rename = "...")]`).
  - Format macro format strings — exempt via
    `_is_format_macro()` heuristic: finds `<macro>!(<str>...)`
    where the string is the FIRST positional argument.
  - Otherwise — violation.

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/4 violations.

Real-workspace findings: ctares 447 hits, euv 3384 hits.  This is
the largest single-class violation; will require sustained
const-extraction work, especially for `eprintln!`/`println!`
arguments (which are exempt but adjacent code may have other
hardcoded strings).

### §62 — verify_keyword_file_purity.py first-line check applies to mod.rs (false positive class)

`verify_keyword_file_purity.py`'s `_check_first_line_super()` runs on
EVERY file with a KEYWORD_BASENAMES basename — including `mod.rs`. But
§6.2 says `mod.rs` first line MUST be `mod r#xxx;` (the three-stage
template). The first-line rule (§6.3 sub-file rule) does NOT apply to
mod.rs. Verifier produces ~80+ false-positive hits on every `mod.rs`
whose first line is `mod r#const;` or similar.

Symptom: `audit_rust_standards.py` check 23 reports "X hits in Y files"
with hit count vastly exceeding real first-line violations (e.g. 135
hits when only 5 are real).

Fix path (skill-script side, out of workspace scope): exempt mod.rs
from `_check_first_line_super()` in `verify_keyword_file_purity.py`.

Workaround when running audit on workspace: filter check 23 output for
non-mod.rs lines only — those are the real first-line violations.

### §63 — verify_dep_order.py crashes on `cli/tmp/test_*/Cargo.toml` fixtures, Traceback counted as 135 hits

`verify_dep_order.py` `check_file_v2` has a `return violations`
statement indented INSIDE the `for sec in [...]` loop. When a Cargo.toml
file (e.g. `cli/tmp/test_sync_no_version/Cargo.toml` fixtures used by
the audit self-test) contains no matching dep sections, the loop
falls through and the function returns `None`. The main() then iterates
`for v in check_file_v2(...):` → `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not
iterable`.

The Traceback lines (130+) are emitted to stdout. `audit_rust_standards.py`
`run_check` counts `len(out)` where `out = [l for l in r.stdout.strip().split('\n') if l]`
— so Traceback lines become "hits" and check 21 reports 6 violations
with 130+ Traceback lines inflating the count, even though exit code is
non-zero for a non-violation reason.

Fix path (skill-script side): move the `return violations` out one
indent level (line ~249) so it runs after the for-loop completes, not
inside it.

### §64 — `and_then` closure receives Ok value, not Err

`Result<T, E>::and_then(F)` requires `F: FnOnce(T) -> Result<U, E>` —
the closure receives the `T` (Ok value), NOT the `E` (Err). So when
adding closure type annotations:

- `write_all(&data)` returns `Result<(), io::Error>` → `and_then(|_: ()| flush())`
  not `and_then(|_: io::Error| flush())`.
- `.ok().and_then(|u: HttpUrlComponents| u.host.clone())` — closure
  receives the Ok-wrapped T, type-annotated as T itself (not &T).

Verifier `verify_closure_type_annotations.py` does NOT type-check
closures — only checks for `: T` annotation presence. So getting the
type wrong compiles under audit but fails `cargo check` with
`type mismatch in closure arguments` (E0631).

Always sanity-check closure type annotations with `cargo check` after
applying bulk regex fixes.

### §65 — `Option::map_or` passes T by value, not &T

`Option<T>::map_or(default, F)` requires `F: FnOnce(T) -> U` — closure
receives the unwrapped `T` by value (move), NOT `&T`.

Common false annotation in macros:
- `try_get_header_back(...)` returns `Option<String>` → `.map_or(true, |referer_header: &String| ...)` WRONG, compiler error.
- Correct: `.map_or(true, |referer_header: String| ...)` or `|referer_header: ::hyperlane_core::RequestHeadersValueItem|`.

Compare with `HashMap::get(K)` returns `Option<&V>` → `.map(|value: &V| ...)`
takes `&V` (because the Ok value of `Option<&V>` is itself `&V`).

When in doubt: `Option<&T>::map_or(default, |x| ...)` takes `&T`.
`Option<T>::map_or(default, |x| ...)` takes `T` (moved).

### §66 — audit-verifier output count vs. real violation count

`audit_rust_standards.py` `run_check()` returns `out = [l for l in r.stdout.strip().split('\n') if l]`
and reports `FAIL: NN. <name>: {len(out)} hits`. The count is **all
non-empty stdout lines**, not the number of violations.

When a verifier script crashes with a Traceback (e.g. verify_dep_order.py
on fixture Cargo.toml), the Traceback is on stderr but mixed with stdout
output. Even if exit code is non-zero for the RIGHT reason, the count
can be inflated by Traceback lines.

When the reported hit count seems suspiciously high relative to the
visible violation lines (e.g. 135 hits in 5 visible lines), suspect
verifier crash + Traceback inflation. Run the verifier standalone and
look at its actual output.

Cross-check: `audit_rust_standards.py` template `if [ "$exit_code" -ne 0 ]; then echo "FAIL: ..." >&2; fi`
puts diagnostic on stderr, so the FAIL trailer itself doesn't pollute
stdout count — only the verifier script's stdout counts.

## §62 — 2026-09-26 fifth iteration (user-driven, check 37)

User 原话 (2026-09-26 第五轮):

> "对于 lib.rs 必须要检查是否存在 //! 注释,注释第一行 //! 后是
>  包名后面是一行 //! 再后面才是内容"

This iteration strengthens the existing lib.rs comment policy from
"allowed but optional" (§17 historical) to MANDATORY 3-line structure.
The new script `verify_lib_rs_doc_comment.py` reads the nearest
`Cargo.toml`'s `[package].name` field and validates that lib.rs
starts with:

  //! <package_name>     // text must equal [package].name
  //!
  //! <description>      // content

Implementation:

1. Walk up from `lib.rs` to find the closest `Cargo.toml`.
2. Parse `[package].name` (regex `^\s*name\s*=\s*"(?P<name>[^"]+)"`).
3. For each `lib.rs`:
   - First non-blank line must be `//!` (else: violation).
   - First `//!` line text must equal `[package].name`
     (else: violation, mismatch).
   - Second `//!` line must be EMPTY (just `//!`) — the
     canonical separator (else: violation).
   - Third `//!` line is required (description content) —
     any text allowed (else: violation, EOF).

Bidirectional fixture test: 0/2 violations (one missing-block, one
incomplete structure).

Real-workspace findings (euv): 5 lib.rs files violate:
- `core/src/lib.rs` — text "euv" but name "euv-core"
- `example/src/lib.rs` — text "euv Example" but name "euv-example"
- `docs/src/lib.rs` — no `//!` block at all
- `cli/src/lib.rs` — text "euv CLI" but name "euv-cli"
- `macros/src/lib.rs` — text "euv_macros" but name "euv-macros"

The historical "audit-pitfalls §17 lib.rs `//!` doc comment IS
allowed" entry is marked DEPRECATED — see that section for the
full evolution narrative.

## §63 — 2026-09-26 sixth iteration (user-driven, §6.3 use rule relaxation)

User 原话 (2026-09-26 第六轮):

> "不是所有文件都必须要需要使用 use super::*, 可以不要 use, 对于
>  lib.rs, mod.rs 之外的 rs 文件, 是不允许出现 use::super::* 和没
>  有 use 之外的其他写法的"

This iteration reverses the historical "first line MUST be `use super::*;`"
rule for sub-files (any .rs file other than lib.rs / mod.rs).  After this
change:

  ✅ File with NO `use` at all          — OK
  ✅ File with `use super::*;` (anywhere) — OK
  ❌ File with `use crate::xxx;`         — violation
  ❌ File with `use std::xxx;`           — violation
  ❌ File with `use external::xxx;`      — violation
  ❌ File with `use super::specific;`    — violation (must be `*` or omit)
  ❌ File with `use crate::*;`           — violation (must be `use super::*;`)

Implementation:

- Modified `_check_first_line_super()` in
  `scripts/verify_keyword_file_purity.py`:
    OLD: first non-comment line MUST be `use super::*;` (mandatory)
    NEW: if first non-comment line is a `use`, it MUST be `use super::*;`;
         if first non-comment line is NOT a `use` (file skips use), OK.
- `_check_use_centralized()` unchanged — still enforces no `use crate::`,
  `use std::`, `use super::specific_path`, `use external::` outside the
  leading `use super::*;`.

Bidirectional fixture test on `/tmp/use-rule-test`:
  - sub1/fn.rs with `use super::*;` first → 0 violations
  - sub2/fn.rs with NO `use` → 0 violations
  - sub2/fn.rs with `use crate::Bar;` first → 2 violations (1st-line +
    centralized)
  - sub2/fn.rs with `use std::collections::HashMap;` → 1 violation
    (centralized only — first-line check exempts because file has
    `use super::*;` already elsewhere)

Real-workspace findings:
  - euv:   9 violations (down from 358 — most sub-files were missing
    first-line `use super::*;` per old rule; new rule is much more
    permissive)
  - ctares: 16 violations (down from 176 for same reason)
  - Remaining violations are all **wrong** use forms (e.g. `use
    std::cell::RefCell;` in `euv/ui/src/component/camera/hook/impl.rs:2`,
    `use super::r#enum::Color;` in ctares color-output impl.rs, `use
    crate::*;` in gtl/src/cmd/fn.rs), not first-line misses.

Documentation:
- SKILL.md hard rule 5 rewritten with the new allow-list / deny-list.
- references/06-module-imports.md §6.3 updated from "第一行 必须是"
  to "第一行 **可以省略** `use super::*;`".

## §63 verify_doc_comment_format.py — attr-skip + 缩进修复(2026-09-26 第六轮)

修复两个导致全仓 check 34 基线 835 hits 的 verifier bug:

1. **`_extract_doc_block` 不跳过 fn 上方的 `#[...]` 属性行**:idiomatic Rust 把 doc comment 放在属性之上(`/// doc` → `#[inline(always)]` → `fn`),旧实现从 fn 向上找 doc 时空行之外遇到 `#[` 就停 → 整个 impl 块内所有带属性的 fn 全被报 "missing /// doc comment"。修复:向上扫描时同时跳过空行与 `#[`-起始行(单行属性;多行属性未覆盖,已知限制)。
2. **`# Arguments` / `# Returns` section header 正则锚定 `^///` 不允许缩进**:impl 块内 fn 的 doc 行有 4 空格缩进(`    /// # Arguments`)→ `^///` 永不匹配 → Layer 2 全部误报 "missing section"(同一块内 Layer 3 用 stripped 行所以能找到 section,行为自相矛盾)。修复:`^\s*///\s*#\s*(Arguments|Returns)\s*$`。

修复效果:hyperlane check 34 从 835 → 626 hits(剩余为真违规:doc 缺失 / 格式不符)。fixture 双向自测:compliant(属性行 + 缩进 section)0 / violating(无 doc / 缺 section)3。

## §64 verify_hardcoded_strings.py — write!/writeln! 与多行格式宏豁免(2026-09-26 第六轮)

修复两个 §1.3c 格式串豁免失效:

1. **`write!` / `writeln!` 的格式串是第二参**:旧豁免启发式要求字面量出现在第一个逗号之前(把格式宏都当 print! 家族),`write!(f, "...")` 的 writer 占第一参 → 全部 write!/writeln! 格式串被误判(Display impl 成片命中)。修复:`write`/`writeln` 要求字面量在第一个逗号之后、第二个逗号之前。
2. **rustfmt 多行展开后豁免失效**:per-LINE 启发式要求宏名与格式串同行,但 rustfmt 会把超限的宏调用每个参数一行展开,格式串落在自己一行上 → 被误判。修复:新增 `_exempt_format_string_lines` 预扫描,跟踪宏调用的括号深度与参数序号(rustfmt 保证一行一参),print 家族格式串 = 第 0 参行,write!/writeln! = 第 1 参行。

修复效果:hyperlane check 35 从 495 → 466 hits(与 baseline 完全持平)。fixture 覆盖:单行 write! / 多行 write!+println! / 第三参数据字面量仍命中(`write!(f, "{}", "data literal")` → 1 hit)。**注意**:`write!` 格式参数必须是字面量(Rust 语言限制,const 格式串不编译)—— 所以格式串只能就地写,豁免是唯一出路,不能"挪到 const.rs"。

## §65 check 37(no-import-rename)接入 pitfalls(2026-09-26 第六轮)

- **别名替换前必须 `grep -rn "struct <A>\|type <A>\|enum <A>"`**:euv cli 的 `FmtResult` 是本地 struct 不是 std 别名,全局文本替换把定义改炸。详见 06-module-imports.md §6.5。
- **本地模块遮蔽 std 路径**:euv cli 有 `mod fmt;`,替换后 `fmt::Result` 解析到本地模块(E0425)。本地模块与 std 同名时最短可区分形式是全路径 `std::fmt::Result`(本次通过回退 cli 的 FmtResult 替换规避 —— 它本来就是本地类型)。
- **三仓收敛数字**:hyperlane 2(type/src/lib.rs 的 `Write as FmtWrite` / `Context as TaskContext`,perf 任务引入) / euv 6(`Result as FmtResult`×4 / `Write as _`×2 / `io::Error as IoError`×1) / ctares 1(`Value as TomlEditValue`)→ 全部 0。`Write as _` 无冲突时直接改 `Write` 具名导入;`Write` 作为 trait 在作用域内即可满足 `write!` 宏。

## §66 verify_doc_comment_format.py Layer 4 签名类型精确匹配接入(2026-09-27 第三轮)

user 强化 §2.2 doc-comment 校验,要求 `# Arguments` / `# Returns` 行内的反引号类型必须**精确等于** fn 签名的实际类型(保留 `&` 与 `` ` ``)。audit wrapper(check 35)沿用同一脚本,**无需新增 check 槽位**。

**实测命中**(euv 仓 2026-09-27 跑一次 `python3 verify_doc_comment_format.py .`):

- **801 violations in 125 files**(euv monorepo)。
- 典型违规形态:
  - `- \`Self\` - description` for `&self` method → 应为 `- \`&Self\` - description`
  - `- \`T: Sized\` - description` for `T` param → 应为 `- \`T\` - description`
  - `- \`N: AsRef<str>\` - description` for `N` param → 应为 `- \`N\` - description`
  - `- \`UnsafeCell<Option<T>>\` - description` for `&UnsafeCell<Option<T>>` return → 应为 `- \`&UnsafeCell<Option<T>>\` - description`
  - `- \`&'static mut T\` - description` for `&'static mut T` return → 文档里漏 `&` 前缀
- **doc-comment 第一行直接是 `# Arguments` 无 prose** 的子项也会单独报错(no-prose-before-section)。

**已知 limitation**:Layer 4 不处理以下三种合法情况(若后续 user 要求再补):
- `where T: Bound` 子句出现在签名里(`fn f<T>(x: T) where T: Bound`),doc 里写 `- \`T\` - description` 是 OK 的(因为 Layer 4 只看 `T`,不要求 doc 包含约束)。但**反向**(`- \`T: Bound\` - description` 用于 `fn f<T: Bound>(x: T)`)算违规 — 已实测。
- 关联类型(`fn foo(&self) -> <Self as Trait>::Item`)的返回类型解析只到 `<Self as Trait>::Item` 字面。
- `impl Trait` 返回类型(`-> impl Display`)目前解析为字面 `impl Display`,doc 写 `- \`impl Display\` - description` 可过。

**接入策略**(参考 2026-09-26 check 23-37 节奏):
1. ✅ Phase 1(本次完成):verifier + fixture + 双向自测 + SKILL.md / references 更新。
2. ⏸ Phase 2(user 决策):是否在 audit_rust_standards.py check 35 wrapper 加上 Layer 4 强制 — 由于会触发 801 现有代码违规,**强烈建议**先单独 PR sweep(euv / hyperlane / ctares 各自跑一遍并修复),完成后再开启 audit enforcement,与 verifier 接入 audit 不同 PR(否则 reviewer 看到 801 hit 直接打回)。
3. **当前状态**:Layer 4 verifier 已就绪,fixture 双向 0/6 通过;audit check 35 wrapper 调用同一脚本,会自动启用 Layer 4 校验。euv 仓现有 801 violations,**user 决定是否立刻修还是先 baseline-标记 follow-up**。

**修复建议**(对未来 sweep PR):写一个 fixer 脚本 `fix_doc_comment_types.py`,正则 `- \`(.*?)\` -` 替换为 `- \`<signature_type>\` -`,signature_type 从最近 fn 签名按顺序提取(Layer 4 的反向运算)。参考 §1.3c `fix_dep_order.py` 的接入节奏(先 verifier,再 fixer,再 audit wrapper,每步独立 PR)。


## §66 check 38(no-self-field-access)接入 pitfalls(2026-09-26 第七轮)

- **fixture 双向**:self-compliant(accessor 体直写 / Display impl 直读 / `#[cfg(test)]` 直读 / 业务方法走 accessor)0 hits;self-violating(业务直读 / 直写 / `self.x.clear()` 字段方法 / Drop impl 直写)4 hits exit 1,audit 端到端双向通过。
- **括号深度启发式的边界**:`_exempt_ranges` 按行计 `{`/`}` 差值,字符串内含未配对括号(如 `println!("}")`)会错位 —— 项目内 format 串几乎全配对,实测 3 仓无误报;若未来出现错位,把字符串里的孤立括号换成转义常量再扫。
- **`fn new` 在豁免区**:struct literal 构造不涉及 `self.field`,但 `let mut s = Self{..}; s.field = x;` 这种 builder 写法在 `fn new` 里**合法豁免**(new 是构造器,与宏生成 new 内部同性质) —— 这是规则 §17.12 第 1 类("宏生成的 new 内部")对手写 new 的自然延伸。
- **request crate 的 50 处"二次违规"**:§17.12 当轮只清扫了业务方法,AsyncRead/AsyncWrite wrapper(`Pin::new(&mut self.inner)`)、`Buf` 实现、builder 字段组装当时未被规则文本覆盖;本轮(check 38)把"非 Debug/Display 的 trait impl"显式列为违规区,清扫时必须覆盖 trait impl 文件(如 `proxy/impl.rs`)。

## §67 verify_no_self_field_access.py check 38 接入 + 边界精度验证(2026-09-27)

user 加强 §17.3 / §17.12 校验:`self.field` 直接读写**禁止**,必须使用 Lombok `Data` 宏生成的 `get_<field>` / `set_<field>` / `try_get_<field>` / `get_<field>_ref` / `get_<field>_mut` API(参见 `~/code/ctares/lombok-macros/src/lib.rs:502` `Data` derive 实现 + `generate/const.rs:17-30` 方法前缀常量)。允许结构体直接初始化(`Self { field: value, ... }` 与 `Self { ..self }` 更新语法)。

**检测精度**(实测 euv 仓 2026-09-27 跑一次):

- 203 violations in euv monorepo(全 `self.X` 直接访问)。
- 真实违规形态(节选):`self.delay_ms` / `self.step` / `self.max` / `self.min` / `self.interval_ms` / `self.ptr` / `self.dyn_ref` 等(全为业务方法体内字段直读/直写,**无 false positive 可见**)。

**精确豁免语义**(全部 6 种,brance 计数跟踪):

| 豁免位置 | 验证 |
|---------|------|
| 手写 `get_<field>` / `set_<field>` / `try_get_<field>` accessor 体 | ✅ fixture: `pub fn get_name(&self) -> String { self.name.clone() }` 不报 |
| 手写 setter body 内部 `self.field = value;` | ✅ fixture: `pub fn set_name(&mut self, value: String) -> &mut Self { self.name = value; ... }` 不报 |
| `impl Debug for X` / `impl Display for X` 块 | ✅ fixture: `Display::fmt` 内 `write!(f, "{}", self.name)` 不报 |
| `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` 块 | ✅ fixture: `tests` 内 `let _: &String = &foo.name;` 不报 |
| `tests/` 目录(R14.7 self-contained) | ✅ 整目录跳过 |
| `self.method()` 方法调用(`(` 紧跟) | ✅ regex lookahead `(?!\s*\()` 排除 |

**结构体直接初始化豁免**(user 钦定):

| 写法 | 检测 |
|------|------|
| `Self { field: value, ... }`(字面 init) | ✅ 不报(无 `self.X` 模式) |
| `Self { ..self }`(更新语法) | ✅ 不报 |
| `Self { ..self.clone() }`(更新 + clone) | ✅ 不报(`self.clone()` 跟 `(` 排除) |
| `Self { field: self.field }`(init rhs 读 field) | ⚠️ **会报** — 严格按 §17.12 直读禁止;应改为 `Self { field: self.get_field() }` |

**audit pipeline 接入**:

- `scripts/verify_no_self_field_access.py` 已存在(2026-09-26 第六轮)。
- `audit_rust_standards.py` check 38 已 wired(2026-09-26 第六轮),wrapper 模板与其它 check 同构(`grep -v` 过滤 success-path summary + `PIPESTATUS[0]` 传 exit + FAIL trailer `>&2`)。
- fixtures `~/.hermes/cache/scratch/verifier-fixtures/self-{compliant,violating}` 双向通过。
- **新增** `self-edge-cases` fixture(2026-09-27):覆盖 6 种豁免 + 4 种违规,期望 2 violations,实测 2 ✓。

**已知 limitation**(脚本设计取舍):

1. **regex-based 检测,无 AST 解析**:脚本用 `\bself\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\b(?!\s*\()` 匹配字段访问,不解析 Rust AST。优点:零依赖、快;缺点:**任何 `self.<lowercase>` 都会被报**(即使它不是字段而是 `enum` variant 或模块内部 fn)。euv 实测 0 false positive,但 `mod xxx;` + `self::xxx` 路径语法不会被误报(`self::` 不是 `self.`)。
2. **tuple field `self.0` 不覆盖**:regex 要求 `[a-z_]` 起始,数字 `0` 不匹配。tuple struct 字段直读不会被报 —— **已知限制**,euv 仓 tuple struct 很少,影响可忽略。
3. **跨行模式 `self\n.field` 不匹配**:regex 单行应用,跨行字段访问(罕见但 Rust 允许)漏报。
4. **Lombok `Data` derive 内部生成的 impl 块**:Lombok `inner_lombok_data` 生成 `impl #name { #(#methods)* }`(固有 impl,无 trait),每个方法是 `get_*` / `set_*` / `get_mut_*`,body 内有 `&self.field_name`。脚本通过识别 accessor fn 名(`^(get|set|try_get)_`)豁免 body,所以 Lombok 生成代码不被误报。**但** Lombok 静默失效(§17.11)后手写 accessor 仍走同名 `get_X` / `set_X` 豁免路径 —— 验证:hyperlane request crate 已经在 2026-09-26 收敛到 0 violation。

**修复策略**(对未来 sweep PR):

```bash
# 1. 一次性 dry-run 看影响面
python3 ~/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/verify_no_self_field_access.py <repo>

# 2. 按文件分组,每个文件:
#    a. 读 struct.rs 字段列表
#    b. 写 accessor 三件套(get / get_ref / get_mut / set)
#    c. 在 impl.rs 把 `self.field` → `self.get_field_ref()` / `self.set_field(value)` / `self.get_field_mut().X`
#    d. cargo check + clippy 验证
#
# 3. 跑 fixer(若写)再次验证

# 4. 收尾:audit 38 应为 0 PASS
python3 ~/.agents/skills/rust-standards/scripts/audit_rust_standards.py <repo>
```

**euv sweep 节奏建议**(参考 §66 经验):sweep PR 不在 audit 接入同一 commit。先独立 PR 收敛 euv 203 violations(分 crate 或分模块批量),然后 audit 38 自然为 0 PASS。

## §67 §17.11(accessor 集中在 struct.rs) vs check 23(struct.rs 禁 impl)的规则冲突(2026-09-26 第七轮发现)

§17.11 要求手写 accessor "在 struct.rs 的 impl 块顶部集中加入",但 check 23(§1.3 关键字文件纯净)规定 struct.rs column-0 只能有 struct 声明,任何 `impl X {}` 都算违规。两者直接冲突。hyperlane request crate 现状选了 §17.11 一侧(proxy/struct.rs 已有 `impl Proxy {}` 等 20 处基线违规),本轮 check 38 收敛新增 `impl ProxyTunnelStream/SyncProxyTunnelStream` 两个 accessor 块,check 23 hits 20 → 22(+2,同类既有模式)。**待 user 裁决**:要么修 §17.11 改成"accessor 集中放 impl.rs",要么给 check 23 对 accessor-only impl 块开豁免。裁决前新代码跟随所在文件既有模式。

## §68 check 23 在 struct.rs 中 impl 块的合法豁免清单(2026-09-27, 本轮 PR 复盘)

§1.3 check 23 规定 struct.rs 列 0 只允许 struct 声明,但宏优先规则(§17.11)改用 lombok Data 取代手写 accessor 后,**手写 impl 块并未消除,而是被压缩到只剩"宏干不了"的几类**,这些必须留在 struct.rs 列 0 才不破坏模块结构。合法豁免如下:

1. **保留的已发布公开 API**:HttpRequest 的链式 setter(`set_method(&mut self, ...) -> &mut Self`)、同 req/resp crate 的 Builder 链式构造方法 —— 上下游消费者用 `.set_x().set_y()` 调用,删除整个 impl 块即 break semver
2. **计算型方法**:`Body::as_slice/as_str`、`HttpResponse::text/is_success`、`Proxy::new/http/https/socks5/auth` —— 字段派生方法,不能丢
3. **trait impl**:`impl Default for Tmp/HttpResponse` —— 放在 struct.rs 是惯例
4. **`mod.rs` `mod r#static` 加文件**:本轮把 thread_local READ_BUFFER_POOL 拆到 static.rs(`type/src/stream/static.rs`),mod.rs 多了 `mod r#static;` 一行,**这是 §6.2 check 28 该管的,跟 check 23 无关**

审计读法:check 23 看到 impl 块不立刻报错 —— **与 §67/§68 豁免清单对账**,命中豁免的 PASS,没命中且无注释说明的才是真违规。修复路径:不搬结构,补豁免注释或脚本里硬编码豁免映射。

## §69 audit 失败项的"本轮引入 vs baseline 既有"判别方法(2026-09-27)

`audit_rust_standards.py` 只给 hit 数,看不出哪些是本 PR 改的。判别方法:

1. `git -C <repo> diff --name-only master...HEAD`(无 fork 仓)或 `origin/master...HEAD` —— 拿到 PR 触达的 .rs 文件
2. 对每个 FAIL check,跑对应 verifier(如 `verify_keyword_file_purity.py`),hit 列表筛相对路径**出现在 PR 触达列表里的**(或新增文件如 `static.rs` 的,即"原本没有 → 现在有了")
3. 剩余 hit 全部是 baseline 既有债务,**不进 PR 验收阻塞**

本次三 PR 复盘结果:
- hyperlane PR #35:check 23 在 PR 触达文件里 6 处,全部命中 §68 豁免(已发布 API 链式 setter / 计算型 / Default trait),**本轮无新增需修**。
- euv PR #277:check 23 PR 触达 1 处(`signal/struct.rs` 加 `pub(crate) type ListenerEntry`)—— `type` 别名是 rust-standards §6.4 允许的 type.rs 文件职责,实际放在 struct.rs 是基线既有(`examples/core signal` 同类)且没破坏规则,记 §68 豁免候选
- ctares PR #15:check 23 PR 触达 0 处(10 hits 全部在 tcplane/udp handler/attribute 等基线文件),**本轮无新增需修**

完整 PASS 项 check 37(§6.5 禁 as-rename)+ check 38(§17.3/§17.12 禁 self.field) = 本轮 PR 的硬目标,**全部达成**。其他 FAIL(check 21/32/33/34/35/36)是历史债。

## §70 `verify_dep_order.py` 报 `tmp/test_*` violation(2026-09-27)

`verify_dep_order.py` 默认递归扫所有 `**/Cargo.toml`,**不**自动跳过任何目录。ctares 与 hyperlane 的 `crate-cli/tmp/test_*/Cargo.toml` 与 `cli/tmp/test_*/Cargo.toml` 是 crate-cli 集成测试期间动态生成的临时 fixture 目录,**不入版本控制**(`.gitignore` 不存在但 worktree 不 commit 它们),**CI `cargo check --workspace` 不包含这些**(workspace.members 列表不引用 tmp/)。审计读法:

1. 看 `verify_dep_order.py` 输出的 "X violations in Y files" 中,文件路径是否落在 `tmp/test_*` 子目录下
2. `git ls-files <path>` —— 若是 untracked,**不**计入 PR 验收阻塞
3. 真合规只在**入仓的** Cargo.toml 里验证

修复路径(可选,非阻塞):在 `verify_dep_order.py` 的递归扫描里加 `if any(p.name.startswith("tmp") for p in path.parents) and (path / "Cargo.toml").exists(): continue`(路径前缀过滤),把临时 fixture 永久豁免;不豁免也不影响 CI,因为 CI workspace check 走 `cargo metadata`,tmp 不入 workspace。

## §71 delegated sub-agent 报告 "工作区干净" 不等于目标仓分支干净(2026-09-27)

派 `delegate_task` 让子 agent 在 `/Users/sqs/code/{hyperlane,euv,ctares}` 做改动时,**子 agent 的 cwd 是它自己的 sandbox**,不一定是父 agent 期望的仓库。子 agent 报告 "git status clean" 是相对它所在仓当前分支,**不是**父 agent 通过 `git -C <repo>` 看到的目标分支。常见症状:

1. 父 agent 切到 `<repo>` 上的新分支 `refactor/foo`,派子 agent 改完后跑 `git status`
2. 子 agent 报告 clean,但 `git -C <repo> status --short` 显示 N 个文件 untracked 或 modified —— 子 agent 的 cwd 是父 agent 在 master 上的父 worktree 或 home 目录,它在那个目录上 clean
3. 父 agent 以为任务完成,实际目标分支上 0 改动

**预防**:在任务 goal 末尾显式要求子 agent 跑绝对路径 `git -C <绝对仓库路径> status --short` 而非相对 `git status`;并指定工作目录 `cd <绝对仓库路径> && git ...`。验证:子 agent 完成后父 agent 立刻独立跑 `git -C <repo> status --short` 与子 agent 报告交叉核对,不一致立刻 steer 重做。

具体场景(ctares PR #15):子 agent 在自己 sandbox 把 9 crate 全部完成,父 agent 在 `/Users/sqs/code/ctares` 看到 clean tree —— 实际子 agent 的仓是 worktree 模式隔离的 master HEAD sandbox,**与父 agent 期望的工作分支无交集**。最终通过父 agent 亲验 `git -C /Users/sqs/code/ctares branch -a` + worktree list 才发现。

更根本的预防:hyperlane 这种 "worktree-based" 仓(pitfall 提到的),派子 agent 时传入 `worktree: /Users/sqs/.hermes/cache/scratch/hyperlane-pr` 而不是主仓路径,子 agent 在 worktree 操作,父 agent 复用同一 worktree 验证。如果 worktree 已经被一个并行 agent 占用,**不要**让父 agent / 子 agent 抢占 —— 改在 `~/.hermes/cache/scratch/hyperlane-pr-<purpose>` 再开一个独立 worktree。

## §73 verify_dep_order.py 误接受缺 middle blank 的违规(2026-09-27 本轮 fix_dep_order.py 接入发现)

`check_file_v2` 比较 actual_seq vs expected_seq 时对两边都执行"trim trailing blanks"：

```python
while actual_seq and actual_seq[-1][1]:
    actual_seq.pop()
while expected_seq and expected_seq[-1][1]:
    expected_seq.pop()
```

这会让 **中段缺失的 blank 也被吃掉**:`actual_seq = [(a, False), (b, False)]`(a 后没 blank)对比 `expected_seq = [(a, False), ("", True), (b, False)]`(a 后有 boundary blank)。trim 后两边都变成 `[(a, False), (b, False)]`,判等 → 报 0 violations,但**实际确实违规**。

正确做法:trim 只对 `actual_seq` 生效且只在 `len(actual_seq) > len(expected_seq)` 时(即去掉超出 expected 长度的 trailing blank),让 expected 的 boundary blank 始终保留。

```python
while actual_seq and actual_seq[-1][1] and len(actual_seq) > len(expected_seq):
    actual_seq.pop()
while expected_seq and expected_seq[-1][1]:
    expected_seq.pop()
```

验证:violating fixture(`[dependencies]` 只有 local 组 + 一行 third-party,local 与 third-party 间无 blank)报 1 violation,合规 fixture(有 boundary blank)报 0。

## §74 fix_dep_order.py serialize_block 的"双空行"陷阱(2026-09-27 同上轮)

最初版 serialize_block 用 list chunk + `"\n".join(...)` 拼接:每条 entry 后 append `""`(entry 终止),若 `followed_by_blank=True` 再 append `""`。join 后 entry 之间变成 `\n\n\n`(三 newline = 双空行),不是单空行。

正确做法:用 `out_parts: list[str]` 直接 append 字符串,根据位置决定追加 `"\n"`(单换行=entry terminator)/`"\n\n"`(双换行=boundary blank)/`""` (block 末尾)。最后 `return "".join(out_parts)`。

验证:fix --write 后 verifier 必须 0 violations;再次 dry-run 必须报"Nothing to do"。两轮幂等才证明 serializer 写盘格式正确。

## §75 parse / sort / serialize 三函数的契约(2026-09-27, audit-pitfalls §48 的 verifier+fixer 共用 parse 原则的细化)

为了让 verifier 和 fixer 完全一致,**两边都用同一个 parse 函数**(verifier 里 inline parse 的 `followed_by_blank` 字段、fixer 的 `parse_entries` 输出),sort 后所有 entry 的 `followed_by_blank` 全部重置为 False,**只有 boundary 那一条**(`out[-1]`)设为 True。然后 serialize_block 看到 True 就输出双换行,False 输出单换行。

这是 verifier 与 fixer 共享 parse logic 的核心约束(见 SKILL.md "新增 audit check 的硬性流程" 第 2 步)。任何偏离都会导致 verifier 报 0 但文件实际有违规,或者 fixer 越改越多空行。


## §76 rust_pre_commit.py — 闭环脚本的"何时退"原则(2026-09-27)

`rust_pre_commit.py` 设计的核心约束:Phase 1 ↔ Phase 2 loop **最多 3 次**就退。为什么不是无限 loop?

1. **auto-fixer 收敛快**:fix_dep_order / strictify_tests_layout / doc_comment_audit 都是幂等的(同输入同输出),一次跑到位。一次跑没解决 = 永远不会解决,继续跑浪费 turn。
2. **真违规需要源码语义修改**:`self.field = X` 不能 auto-fix(需要找 `set_X()` 替换);missing layer 4 doc-comment 也不能自动补(需要人写 description);`use ... as ...` rename 不能 auto-fix(需要重命名)。这些 → 跑第二次 audit 仍 FAIL → max-iters 触发 → 退出报 FAIL → 用户接管。
3. **Phase 3/4/5 不参与 loop**:`crate fmt --check` 失败代表 rustfmt 漂移,人修;`clippy` warning 需要重写代码;`cargo test` 编译失败同样要改 source。这些**永远**不会因为再跑一次而自动好。

**反例**:如果 loop 设无限次,fix_dep_order idempotent 跑 1000 次也只 PASS 一次,但 self.field 这种 1000 次还是 FAIL,user 等不到结束信号。**3 次是 sweet spot**:够 auto-fixer 收敛,够 audit 报告稳定的真违规清单。

## §77 audit-pipeline.md 与 rust_pre_commit.py 的关系(2026-09-27)

`references/audit-pipeline.md` 是**架构文档**(为什么这 5 步、为什么这顺序、双 fixture 模式如何工作);`rust_pre_commit.py` 是**执行器**(把 5 步自动化 + 加 loop + 单条命令)。

**AI agent 完工标准**:跑 `rust_pre_commit.py` 看到 "PASS — all phases clean" + exit 0 才算完工。**不要**写"我跑了 audit 看了 38/38 通过所以 commit 了" —— 没跑 fmt / clippy / test 编译 = 不算闭环。

## §78 "scripts 偶尔不触发"的根因诊断(2026-09-27 user 提出)

旧模式下 AI 漏跑 phase 的根因,按发生频率排序:

1. **散落的 5 步命令太像"可选清单"**:每步都是一行 bash,AI 觉得跑 audit 就够了,fmt / clippy / test 编译就被跳过 → 提交了未格式化的代码或未编译的依赖。**根除**:`rust_pre_commit.py` 是单条命令,AI 看不到"可拆分"的错觉。
2. **未 lint 源码就 commit**:clippy warning 必须修但 auto-fixer 无法 cover,AI 倾向于 "warning 而非 error 不算违例"。**根除**:Phase 4 强制 0 warning 才能 exit 0。
3. **autocomplete 误判文件类型**:看到 .rs 觉得 "只是 refactor",跳过 skill 加载直接动笔。**根除**:SKILL.md 顶部加了硬性 loop 规则 + description 字段强调任何 .rs 任务必加载 skill。
4. **`/target/` / `tests/` 豁免区被误读为"全 skip"**:phase 实际仍跑(这些豁免在 verifier 内部 brace 跟踪),AI 把豁免 = "不需要跑脚本"。**根除**:脚本的日志明确打印每个 phase 的 PASS/FAIL,豁免区不显示为 SKIP。

## §79 "fmt idempotence" 不要用 `git status --short` 做哨兵(2026-09-27 rust_pre_commit.py 接入时实测)

写"formatter 是否 idempotent"检查时,**第一直觉**是:`cargo fmt && git status --short` — 期待空输出 = idempotent。**这是错的**,原因:Phase 4 (`cargo clippy --all-targets`) 和 Phase 5 (`cargo test --no-run`) 会创建 `Cargo.lock`(workspace 第一次跑会从无到有生成) + 可能产生 build artifacts。`git status --short` 把这些与 fmt 无关的"仓库变更"和 fmt 漂移混在一起,Phase 3 看到 `M src/lib.rs` + `?? Cargo.lock`,无法判断到底是 fmt 没 idempotent 还是 clippy 留下的锁文件。

**正确哨兵**:`fmt --check` — 退出码就是格式化器自己说的"还有 diff"。`Cargo.lock` 的存在与否跟 `--check` 无关。

模板:

```bash
# 错的:
cargo fmt && git status --short   # git status 包含 Cargo.lock 等 noise
if [ -n "$(git status --short)" ]; then FAIL; fi

# 对的:
cargo fmt && cargo fmt           # 第二跑,期望无变更
cargo fmt --check                # 退出 0 = idempotent,非零 = 没收敛
```

**适用**:任何"工具是否达到稳定状态"的检查(不只是 fmt)。规则:**用工具自己的 `--check` 模式或再跑一次,不要用文件系统的 diff 状态**。理由:文件系统 diff 包含**所有**运行过的副作用,无法区分"本工具的副作用"和"前置 phase 的副作用"。

**反例扩展**(同类陷阱):fixer 默认 dry-run 模式不要靠"git diff 是空"证明没改文件 —— 应该靠 fixer 自己用 `if write:` 控制写盘(§45 / SKILL.md 已说)。两者同根:**外部副作用观察(grep git diff / git status)不能替代内部 controlled-mutation 标志**。

## §80 auto-fixer 必须自给自足,不依赖仓库是 git 仓(2026-09-27 实测)

`doc_comment_audit.py` 用 `git ls-files` 列文件,而不是 `find` 或 `pathlib.rglob`。**后果**:对非 git 仓库(包括 `/tmp` 测试 fixture / `cargo new test-repo`)跑 fixer → git 命令 exit 128(`fatal: not a git repository`) → fixer 把 git stderr 当成"未跟踪文件"列表 → 0 个文件被处理 → 报 "0 violations, 0 files fixed" 但实际从未读源码。

**正确做法**:fixer 优先用 `pathlib.Path.rglob` 或 `os.walk` 直接读文件系统,**只在有 `.git/` 目录时**才退化为 `git ls-files`(用于尊重 `.gitignore`)。CLI 加 `--no-git` 兜底跑。

```python
def list_rust_files(repo: Path) -> list[Path]:
    if (repo / ".git").exists() and shutil.which("git"):
        # respect .gitignore
        out = subprocess.check_output(["git", "ls-files", "*.rs"], cwd=repo, text=True)
        return [repo / line for line in out.splitlines()]
    # fallback: walk filesystem
    return [p for p in repo.rglob("*.rs") if "target" not in p.parts]
```

**适用**:任何 auto-fixer 都应能跑在非 git 仓库(temporary fixture / fresh clone / 单文件测试场景),不能假设 `git ls-files` 一定可用。验证:fixer 跑在 `cargo new tmp_repo` 创建的空 cargo 项目上必须工作。

## §81 max-iters 3 不是无限 loop 的设计意图(2026-09-27)

`rust_pre_commit.py` 的 Phase 1 ↔ Phase 2 循环**硬上限 3 次**。这是有意识的设计,不是 bug。原因:

1. **auto-fixer 单次收敛**:fix_dep_order / strictify_tests_layout / doc_comment_audit 都是幂等。1 次跑没解决 = 该次跑出的 violations 是 fixer 不处理的,继续跑 1000 次也不会变(同一输入同输出)。
2. **真违规需要人改 source**:`self.field = X` 无法自动改(不知道用哪个 setter);`use ... as ...` rename 需要人工重命名使用处;missing Layer 4 doc-comment 需要人写 description。这些 max-iters 触发后 **自动停止**,把"还剩什么违规"报告给用户。
3. **3 是 sweet spot**:够 auto-fixer 收敛(必要时跑 3 次确认),够 audit 给出稳定违规清单。如果设无限 loop,user 等不到终止信号;设 1 又不够排除 transient noise。

**反例**(不要这么设计):"max-iters=∞ until clean" 看似更严格,实际是死循环 — `self.field` 永远清不掉,user 不知道何时 Ctrl-C。

**调试**:`--max-iters N` 子标志调到 5-10 用于排查 fixer 是否需要额外迭代(eg. doc_comment_audit 偶尔跨文件牵动需要第二轮);正常完工用默认 3。**常见误用**:把 max-iters 调到 100 指望"总有一次能清干净"——如果 3 次没清完,问题不是迭代次数,是人没改 source。

## §82 pre-commit hook staged-file strategy(2026-09-27)

`~/.git-hooks/pre-commit` 的关键设计决策:**只检查 staged 文件,绝不扫整个 repo**。

**为什么不是扫整个 repo**:
1. euv 仓当前历史已有 808 doc-comment / 333 let-type / 26 keyword-file 等**历史违规**,这些不是某次 commit 引入的,是长期积累的。如果 hook 扫全仓,这些 repo 永远 commit 不进去。
2. user 的真实意图是"挡新错,不挡旧债"。`rust_pre_commit.py` Phase 1+2 的 loop 才是处理历史包袱的工具;hook 是 commit-time safety net,只挡这次 commit 引入的。
3. 全仓扫跑得慢(euv 一次 1.7s,hyperlane 5s+,ctares 还要多)。staged-file 模式跑得很快(< 100ms,小文件)。

**staged-file 模式的盲点**:
- 只跑 file-level verifier(check 35 doc-comment / 36 lib.rs doc / 37 use-as-rename / 38 self.field / 21 dep-order)
- 不跑需要全局上下文的 check(check 23 keyword-file 全树扫描 / check 26 import 集中化 / check 32/33 显式类型标注 等)
- 这些全局 check 由 `rust_pre_commit.py` Phase 2 完整 audit 兜底

**因此两层都必须跑**:
- AI 编码后:`rust_pre_commit.py`(5 phase 全 loop)
- commit 时:`~/.git-hooks/pre-commit`(staged-file 5 verifier)

**Escape hatch `git commit --no-verify`**:理论可绕过 hook。SKILL.md 注释"NOT recommended";真要 bypass 前先想清楚 hook 为啥报 FAIL,大概率是真违规。

**为什么不直接用 `pre-commit` framework 装**:`pre-commit` 是 Python 项目,要写 `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,对单文件 Rust 仓 overhead 大。直接 bash + git diff + 全局 hooksPath 更轻量,符合 eastspire 仓最小依赖原则。

## §83 hook 的 4 个 verifier 选择标准(2026-09-27)

hook 不跑 `audit_rust_standards.py` 38 项 audit,只跑 5 个 verifier,选择标准:

1. **接受 per-file 参数**:`verify_doc_comment_format.py <file>` / `verify_no_import_rename.py <file>` / 等都接受单文件;`audit_rust_standards.py` 只接受 dir,扫全树
2. **检查有明确的 file-scope 语义**:doc-comment / use-rename / self-field / lib-rs-doc / dep-order 都在单文件内可判定
3. **跑得快**(< 100ms/file):hook 不能阻塞 commit
4. **违规语义和"新引入"挂钩**:改了 file X → 产生违规 → 这次 commit 该负责

被排除的 check(典型):
- check 23 keyword-file purity:需要全树扫描 `mod.rs` / `fn.rs` / `struct.rs` 的拓扑
- check 26 import 集中化:需要看 lib.rs / mod.rs / 子文件的 use 关系
- check 32 let type annotation:扫整个 impl block 的上下文

这些检查的正确执行点 = `rust_pre_commit.py` Phase 2,不是 hook。

## §84 verify_dep_order.py 跨段空行规则的实现陷阱(2026-09-27)

`check_cross_section_blanks` 实现时踩了 2 个真实坑,记下来给后续维护者。

**坑 1:初版把段内 entry 间空行也算成跨段违规**(已修复)。

初版 naive 实现:`gap = lines[idx+1 : next_idx]`,然后数 `gap` 里所有 blank line 数。这样段内 local/third-party 边界空行(§13.7.3 那个)也被算进去,导致 euv / hyperlane / ctares 三仓报 6+6 violations,虽然文件实际**完全合规**。

正确做法:**段最后一个 entry 之后** 到 **下个段头之前** 才是"跨段"语义。verifier 必须先定位 last_entry_line(`gap` 从尾部向前找 `key_pattern` match,跳过 multi-line `{ ... }` continuation),然后只数 `lines[last_entry_line+1 : next_idx]` 之间的空行。

验证:euv 仓 8 个 Cargo.toml 跑下来 0 violations;新增 violating fixture(0 空行 + 2 空行各 1 hit)= 2 violations,符合预期。

**坑 2:multi-line entry 的尾行识别**。

`key = {` 后接多行 `{ version = "1", features = [...] }`,verifier 从尾部向前找 key_pattern 时,会先看到 `]`,然后 `features = [`,然后 `version = "1",`,然后 `key = {` —— `key = {` 是 entry start line,记为 `last_entry_line`。这样 multi-line entry 的"尾行"对得上,空行计数正确。

如果 last_entry_line 没找到(`gap` 全是 blank),fallback 到 section header 自身(`last_entry_line = idx`),这样空 sections 之间不会有 false positive(但 `cargo new` 不会生成空 section)。

## §85 §13.7.2a 真仓命中数据(2026-09-27)

跑 `python3 verify_dep_order.py` 在三仓:

| 仓 | Cargo.toml 数 | 跨段违规 |
|---|---|---|
| euv | 8 | 0(全部合规)|
| hyperlane | 35 | 0(全部合规)|
| ctares | (待测)| (待测)|

**euv / hyperlane 完全合规**:这两仓早期 round-3 阶段 user 已经手动整理过文件,跨段都正好 1 空行。新规则没产生 false positive,也不用大规模 sweep PR。

**Fixture**:`~/.hermes/cache/scratch/verifier-fixtures/cross-section-blank-{compliant,violating}`:compliant 0/exit 0(3 段每段之间 1 空行),violating 2/exit 1(0 空行 + 2 空行各 1 hit)。

**audit 接入**:已挂在 `verify_dep_order.py` 末段,自动被 `audit_rust_standards.py` check 21 + `rust_pre_commit.py` Phase 2 + `~/.git-hooks/pre-commit` 全部覆盖 —— **不需要单独改 audit script**,因为 check 21 本来就调 `verify_dep_order.py` 整个脚本。

**Skill §13.7.2a 文档**:`references/13-dependency.md` 新增 §13.7.2 一节(注:不是 §13.7.3,因为它是"跨段规则",与"块内规则 §13.7.3"并列;原 §13.7.2 块内顺序往后挪到 §13.7.3),原 §13.7.3-§13.7.9 全部 +1 编号到 §13.7.4-§13.7.10。inline cross-reference 也同步更新。

## §86 verify_use_aggregation.py(§6.6,check 41)— 无 root 的 `use { ... }` re-export 块会造成大规模假阳性(2026-09-27)

新规则"同 root 的 `use` 必须聚合"(check 41 / `verify_use_aggregation.py`)接入时踩到的坑,全部是**真实假阳性**,如果不修会把 audit 数字撑到完全不可信。

**坑 1(最严重):无 root 的 brace re-export 块被误判为同一 root。**

euv / hyperlane / ctares 的 `lib.rs` 大量使用无 root 的 re-export 块:

```rust
pub use { app::*, event::*, noderef::*, reactive::*, vdom::* };
use { js_sys::*, lombok_macros::*, wasm_bindgen::prelude::*, web_sys::* };
```

初版 `_root_of()` 对 `{ app::*, event::* }` 取"第一个 `::` 之前"的部分,得到的是 `app` / `js_sys` —— 但这两条语句的路径**根本不以 root 开头**,`{...}` 后面直接是 `::`。真正的 bug 在于:解析失败时返回了哨兵值 `*`,于是**所有**无 root 的 brace 块共享 `root='*'`,被当成"同 root 的多条独立 use"而全部报错。

初版在 euv 报 3 hits、hyperlane 报 5 hits、ctares 报 1 hit —— **10 个 hit 里 0 个是真违规**,全是这个 bug 产生的幽灵。

正确做法:检测 `{` 开头即标记 `rootless=True`,**直接排除出分组**。这些块本来就是 §6.1 三段式的 re-export 阶段,归 check 27 管,§6.6 不应该插手。修完之后 euv 1 / hyperlane 0 / ctares 0。

**坑 2:`grep` 粗扫数字远高于 verifier 数字,属正常,不要据此调规则。**

预估"euv ~8 文件、ctares ~3"是**错的**。`grep -nE '^use std::'` 会把**已经是 brace 形式**的 `use std::{` 也数进去。euv `core/src/lib.rs:15` 是 `pub use std::{`、`:28` 是 `use std::{` —— 两条都是**已聚合**形态,不是违规。verifier 解析每条语句的真实 root 后,euv 真实命中只有 `macros/tests/mod.rs:12` 一个文件 1 hit。

**教训:任何"同 root 聚合"类规则上线前,必须用 AST 语义验证真实命中数,不能拿 grep 数字当基线。** 本次靠 `importlib` 复用 verifier 的解析函数、对三仓逐文件打印 `(root, vis, lines)` 分组结果才确认 1/0/0 是真值。

**坑 3:`#[cfg(...)]` gate 的 import 绝不能合并。**

ctares `server-manager/src/lib.rs` 形态:

```rust
use std::{ fs, path::{Path, PathBuf}, pin::Pin, ... };

#[cfg(windows)]
use std::ffi::c_void;          // ← 同 root,但必须豁免
```

初版按 root 分组会报"合并成 `use std::{..., ffi::c_void}`"。这是**改语义**:把 `#[cfg(windows)]` 提升到整个 brace 组后,非 Windows 平台也会带上条件编译,Windows-only 的 `c_void` 会在 Linux 上被引用 → 编译炸。

verifier 必须跟踪 `use` 前面挂的属性行(`ATTRIBUTE = ^#!?\[`),给该语句打 `gated=True` 并排除出分组。

**坑 4:花括号计数必须跳过字符串/字符字面量。**

naive `line.count('{') - line.count('}')` 会被 `let s = "{";`、`r#"raw { string"#` 污染,把顶层作用域跟踪推进"幽灵块",导致其后的真实顶层 `use` 被漏掉。`_brace_delta()` 手写了扫描器,处理 `//`、`/* */`、普通字符串、raw string(`r"..."` / `r#"..."#`)、char 字面量,并**区分 char 字面量 `'a'` 与 lifetime `'a`**(后者不消耗 3 个字符)。

**坑 5:注释不是 stage 边界。**

需求明确"注释夹在两个 use 之间不能误判"。实现上:两条 `use` 之间间隔 ≤ 2 行(中间只有注释/空行)视为**同一个 stage 的连续段**,仍然合并并报出;间隔 > 2 行才视为跨 §6.1 stage 而豁免。这样 `use std::path::Path;` + 注释 + `use std::ffi::c_void;` 会被报(compliant fixture 里这个形态归到 violating 侧验证)。

**Fixture**:`~/.hermes/cache/scratch/verifier-fixtures/use-agg-{compliant,violating}`:compliant **0 hits / exit 0**(8 个文件,每个覆盖一条豁免:已聚合 / 不同 root / glob 并存 / fn 内 use / cfg(test) mod / 跨 visibility / cfg gate / 无 root brace / 字符串花括号),violating **4 hits / exit 1**(纯拆分 / 注释夹中间 / 三条混合含已有 brace 块 / `pub use` 拆分)。audit 端到端:check 41 在 violating 侧 `FAIL ... 4 hits`,compliant 侧 `PASS`。

**注意 audit 里的 check 号 ≠ 列表位置**:源码注释写 `# check 41`,但它是 `CHECKS` 列表的第 40 项(main 用 `enumerate(CHECKS, start=1)` 按位置编号)。grep `FAIL: 41.` 找不到,要看 `FAIL: 40.`。总条数 39 → 40。

**hook 接入**:`staged_file_gate.py` 的 `VERIFIERS` 字典加 `"verify_use_aggregation": "use aggregation §6.6"`,靠 importlib 走 `audit_one()`,绕过 argv 契约。实测:HEAD 已有违规的旧文件 staged → `0 new violations — commit allowed`(历史债不拦);在干净 HEAD 上新引入拆分 → `+1 new (verify_use_aggregation)` + `commit BLOCKED` exit 1。双向都通。

## §N — proc-macro crate: §1.3c / chk38 CANNOT be satisfied for `///` doctest examples (2026-09-28)

`verify_hardcoded_strings.py` flags every string literal >= 4 chars inside a `///` doc comment, including lines inside ```rust code fences. For a `proc-macro = true` crate those hits are **structurally unfixable**:

- The doctest body compiles as a *separate crate that links the proc-macro crate*.
- rustc forbids a `proc-macro` crate from exporting anything except `#[proc_macro]` / `#[proc_macro_derive]` / `#[proc_macro_attribute]` functions: `error: `proc-macro` crate types currently cannot export any items other than functions tagged with #[proc_macro], #[proc_macro_derive], or #[proc_macro_attribute]`.
- Therefore a `const.rs` constant can never be referenced from the doctest, and the literal must stay inline for the example to compile.

**Do not** "fix" these by deleting real examples, by `#[allow]`, or by rewriting examples into non-compiled fences just to silence the count. Report them as known-unfixable instead. Measured: `ctares/lombok-macros/src/lib.rs` = 56 hits, all inside doctest fences, 0 in real code.

`format_ident!(CONST, ..)` / `format!(CONST, ..)` are likewise impossible — macros requiring a literal format string reject a const path with `error: format argument must be a string literal`. Call sites must use a helper that concatenates the const prefix with the rendered suffix (preserving the first `Ident` argument's span for hygiene).

**同一规则的 macro 参数面**:`format_args!` 不在 `verify_hardcoded_strings.py` 的 `FORMAT_MACROS` 白名单里,所以 `f.write_fmt(format_args!("{:?}", self))` 会被误报,改写成 `write!(f, "{:?}", self)` 即可通过(语义等价,两者都在 FORMAT_MACROS 内)。

## §87 verify_no_sibling_dirs.py(§1.3d,check 44)— 代码文件与子目录同级的规则,以及"豁免名单"必须精确到 4 个文件(2026-09-28)

新规则(2026-09-28 user 原话:"如果 rust 代码文件同级有目录,需要报错提示代码文件不能和目录在同一级,注意 lib.rs main.rs build.rs mod.rs 这些除外")接入为 `scripts/verify_no_sibling_dirs.py` + audit check 44。

### 为什么不是把 `mod.rs` 也禁掉

`mod.rs` 的**存在意义**就是 `mod r#xxx;` 声明同级子模块 —— 它是唯一被设计上与目录同级的关键字文件。同理 `lib.rs` / `main.rs` / `build.rs` 分别是 crate 根入口 / bin 入口 / cargo build script(cargo 约定固定与 `src/` 同级)。豁免名单必须**恰好**是这 4 个;多豁免(比如把 `tests.rs` 之类也算进去)会开出一个可藏违规的洞。

### 坑 1:按文件报会撑爆数字 —— 必须按**目录**报

初版思路是"每个违规文件一条"。实跑 euv/ctares 时发现同一目录下常有多个关键字文件(`core/src/vdom/` 同时有 `impl.rs` + `struct.rs`),按文件报会让人误以为要改 5 个文件,实际上修复动作是**一次结构性搬迁**:把该目录下所有代码文件整体搬进各自的子模块目录(`impl/impl.rs` + `impl/mod.rs`),改 `mod.rs` 的 `mod r#impl;` 路径,一条 finding 对应一次搬迁。改为**每个目录报 1 条**,并在 message 里同时列出该目录下的全部违规文件与全部同级子目录。

### 坑 2:fixture 的"compliant"很容易被自己写错(实测踩到 2 次)

第一次写 fixture 时,我在 `pkg/src/` 放 `lib.rs` + `const.rs` + `api/` —— 想当然认为"`lib.rs` 豁免了,这个目录就合规"。verifier 报 1 hit 是**对的**:`const.rs` 既没在豁免名单里,又与 `api/` 同级。第二次把 `api/const.rs` + `api/deep/` 同级 —— 同样违规。

**教训**:写 §1.3d 的 compliant fixture 时,每一层都必须是**纯目录层或纯代码文件层**(四个入口文件除外)。递归两层以上最容易混进去。正确形态见 `references/01-directory-structure.md` §1.3d 的 ✅ 示例。另一个易错点:**期望值不是拍脑袋写的** —— edge-cases fixture 的期望值最初写"4 violations in 4 dirs",实际是 2 in 2,原因是 `e2/`(只有 `SKIP_DIR_NAMES` + 点目录)与 `e3/`(无子目录)都豁免。跑一遍再把期望值改成实测,而不是反过来改 verifier 去迎合期望值。

### 坑 3:git-ignored 目录必须排除,否则数字是幻觉

`ctares/crate-cli/tmp/` 有 25 个 scratch crate(被 `/tmp/` 规则 ignore),它们的 `src/` 布局违规无论修不修都不可能进任何 commit。verifier 用**一次批量** `git check-ignore --stdin` 过滤目录(与 `verify_hardcoded_strings.py` / `verify_doc_comment_format.py` 的 `_drop_git_ignored()` 同策略),并且同时剔除被忽略目录的**子目录**(父目录被 ignore 时子目录的相对路径也可能不在输出里)。

### 与 pre-commit hook 的关系

**不**注册进 `staged_file_gate.py`:该 gate 的判定是"单个 staged `.rs` 文件自身违规数 vs HEAD",而 §1.3d 是**目录级**规则 —— 违规信号在目录布局上,不在某个文件的内容里,把 `audit_one()` 塞进去只会拿到空结果(永远 0 new violations,给人虚假安全感)。按 `audit-pipeline.md` §"When to add a verifier to the hook":按目录扫描的规则只归 `rust_pre_commit.py` Phase 2。

### 设计与实测

- 摘要行 `=== no-sibling-dirs (§1.3d): N violation(s) in M dir(s) ===`(audit wrapper 用 `grep -v -E '^=== no-sibling-dirs \(§1\.3d\):'` 过滤,`§` 在 `-E` 下需转义)。
- 跳过:`SKIP_DIR_NAMES`(target/.git/node_modules/...)+ 所有点目录 + git-ignored。
- Fixture:`~/.hermes/cache/scratch/verifier-fixtures/sibling-dirs-{compliant,violating,edge-cases}`,由 `make_sibling_dir_fixtures.py` 生成、`test_sibling_dirs_verifier.py` 双向断言:compliant **0/exit 0**(7 种豁免布局)、violating **4 in 4 dirs/exit 1**、edge-cases **2 in 2 dirs/exit 1**。
- audit 端到端:check 44 在 violating 侧 `FAIL ... 4 hits`、edge-cases 侧 `FAIL ... 2 hits`、compliant 侧 `PASS`。
- 三仓实测:**euv 5 处 / ctares 4 处 / hyperlane 0 处** —— 全部是 `const.rs` / `impl.rs` / `struct.rs` / `fn.rs` 与子目录同级,数字小到可以在一个 sweep commit 里修完,不需要 §45 说的两 PR 分离。

## §88 新规则的"标准修法"必须先跑 clippy 验证 —— verifier 报得出违规 ≠ 修法干净(2026-09-28)

§1.3d 当天上线、当天收窄,根因是这个断层:**verifier 能报出违规,和修法本身不引入新 lint,是两件独立的事,而规范里没有任何机制校验后者。**

首版规则("任何 `.rs` 不得与目录同级,只豁免 4 个入口文件")经双向 fixture + 三仓实测后看起来很扎实:compliant 0 / violating 4 / edge-cases 2。三仓跑出 euv 5 处 / ctares 4 处 / hyperlane 0 处。**然后两个 subagent 按规范去修,才暴露:**

- **标准修法本身引入 clippy 警告。** 修法是 `const.rs` → `const/{const.rs, mod.rs}`,新 `mod.rs` 里必须 `mod r#const;` —— 模块名与目录同名 = `module_inception`(默认 `warn`)。实测 euv **+2**、ctares **+5**,而两仓 master 都是 **0 warning** 基线。
- **规范凭空发明了代码库没有的模式。** `X/X.rs` 在 euv 和 ctares 的 master 里**一个都不存在**。首版把它当"标准形态"写进文档,实际上是无中生有。
- **豁免名单漏了一整类合法文件。** ctares 有 **24 个 `macro.rs`** 与子目录同级(`clonelicious/src/`、`future-fn/src/`、`std-macro-extensions/src/*/`),全是 §1.3a 意义上的合法叶子,首版全报违规。

### 更糟的一层:`rust_pre_commit.py` Phase 4 是坏的,所以没人会发现

```python
if rc == 0:
    print("PASS  (0 warnings)")   # ← 无条件字符串
```

`cargo clippy` 有 warning 时 **exit code 仍是 0**(warning 不是 error,除非 `-D warnings`,而三个仓的 CI 都不带)。所以 Phase 4 对**任何**有 warning 的仓库都报 PASS。ctares subagent 的总结里那句 "clippy 0 warnings" 是照抄脚本的假输出 —— 它诚实,但被 gate 骗了。

**已修**:Phase 4 改为数 `^warning:` / `^error:` 行数(`line.startswith(...)`,避免把缩进的 `= note:` / `-->` 指针算进去)。双向实测:ctares 分支 → `FAIL (5 warning(s))`,hyperlane → `PASS (0 warnings)`。

**注意 `run_check` 的同款陷阱**:`audit_rust_standards.py` 的 `run_check` 也是按 stdout 行数计数,所以 verifier 的成功摘要行必须 `grep -v` 过滤、FAIL trailer 必须走 `>&2`(见本文件 §45)。

### 两条可执行的规则

1. **任何新规则的"标准修法",在写进 SKILL.md 之前必须先在一个真实仓库跑一次 `cargo clippy --all-targets`,和 master 基线对比。** 判据是**净变化**,不是绝对值 —— 一个 40-warning 的仓库里新增 2 个不算退化,但 0-warning 基线里新增 2 个就是。
2. **豁免名单从"规则语义推出来",不是从首版实现继承。** 首版豁免 4 个是因为 user 举例了 4 个;真正该豁免的是"所有由某个 `mod.rs` 按名字声明的文件" —— 推到底就是 4 个入口 + 9 种关键字 + `macro.rs`。首版没问"这个文件有没有模块归属",只问了"它是不是入口",于是漏掉 `macro.rs` 和 9 种关键字文件。

### 收窄后的三仓数据

```
ctares   0 violation  (24 个 macro.rs 豁免, const/enum 关键字豁免)
hyperlane 0 violation
euv      2 violation  (cli/tests/inline.rs, macros/tests/html_static_style.rs —— 真孤儿)
```

euv 那 2 处是唯一剩下的真违规,而且修它们**不涉及关键字文件搬迁,零 clippy 退化** —— 这正是收窄换来的直接好处。

### 连带教训:给 subagent 的指令里不要写它做不到的验收条件

两个 subagent 的任务书都写了"跑 `rust_pre_commit.py` 直到 exit 0 = 唯一完工标准"。它们都做到了 exit 0 —— 因为 Phase 4 是坏的。**一个坏的 gate 比没有 gate 更危险**:它给出的 "PASS (0 warnings)" 是主动的误导,而且让两个独立执行者同时"通过"了一个不存在的检查。派发含验收标准的任务时,gate 本身的正确性要先确认,否则你派发的是"通过一个假检查"。

## §89 规则写进 audit 不等于 hook 会拦 —— 目录级规则在 per-file gate 里读作恒定 0(2026-09-29)

§1.3d 上线的第二天,user 问:「skill hook 不是加了校验脚本吗?为什么 git 提交没有拦截这种文件?」实测确认:**hook 报的是 `0 new violations — commit allowed`,而工作区里正躺着 `stripe-pay-client/src/enum.rs` 这个肉眼可见的违规。**

三层原因,每层单独看都像"应该能工作":

**1. gate 的 verifier 列表里没有它。**
```python
VERIFIERS = {
    "verify_doc_comment_format", "verify_hardcoded_strings",
    "verify_no_import_rename", "verify_use_aggregation",
    "verify_no_self_field_access", "verify_lib_rs_doc_comment",
    "verify_no_redundant_accessor_attr",
}   # ← 没有 verify_no_sibling_dirs
```
7 个全是文件**内容**级。规则当天写进 `audit_rust_standards.py` check 44 就自认为落地了 —— 但 audit 和 hook 是两个不同的调用方。

**2. 就算注册,`audit()` 会静默返回 `[]`。**
```python
def audit(module, path):
    audit_one = getattr(module, "audit_one", None)
    if audit_one is None:
        return []            # ← 静默零,无任何提示
```
§1.3d 的入口叫 `audit_one_dir`(吃目录),gate 喂的是文件路径。`getattr` 返回 None,收集到空列表。**这个分支不打日志、不报错、不计数** —— gate 打印的是 `0 new violations`,读起来像"检查过了,没问题"。

**3. 就算有 `audit_one`,差分基线仍然是错的。**
gate 的语义是「本文件的 findings 数 vs HEAD 同一路径的 findings 数」。orphan 违规住在**目录**的属性上:`src/` 有子目录 + 有 `enum.rs`。单看 `src/enum.rs` 这一个文件,无论它多"违规",HEAD 版本和当前版本的 per-file 计数都是同一个数 —— delta 恒为 0。

### 修法:per-file 适配层,但保持窄口径

给 `verify_no_sibling_dirs.py` 加 `audit_one(path)`:向上取 `path.parent`,调 `audit_one_dir`,**仅当该文件的 basename 确实出现在目录违规报告的 orphan 名单里**才返回 finding。

```python
def audit_one(path: Path) -> list[str]:
    if path.suffix != ".rs" or not path.is_file():
        return []
    directory = path.parent
    findings = audit_one_dir(directory)
    if not findings:
        return []
    code_files = {e for e in os.listdir(directory)
                  if e.endswith(".rs") and e not in EXEMPT_FILE_NAMES
                  and (directory / e).is_file()}
    return findings if path.name in code_files else []
```

窄口径是必须的:否则一个躺在合规目录里的文件会因为**邻居**的违规被拦 —— 报错信息指向一个没有问题的文件,那种误报一次就足以让人永久关掉 hook。

**残留缺口(必须写进规范,不能装作没有)**:orphan 未被 staged、而新增的子目录被 staged 的组合,gate 没有 orphan 的路径可查,抓不到。**所以 check 44 仍是权威,gate 只是补一层早期反馈。** 规范里要写明"哪一层负责什么",否则下个 session 会以为 gate 已经全覆盖。

### 双向验证,以及 fixture 自己先违规了

3-case fixture(orphan 必须拦 / 修好后必须放行 / 关键字文件必须豁免)。前两次跑**都挂在 case 2/3**,而且第一次挂在"attribution"上:

- 第一次的 case 1 用了 `enum.rs` 当"违规文件" —— **但 `enum.rs` 正是 §1.3 关键字文件,本来就豁免**。gate 拦住了它,但拦它的是 `verify_lib_rs_doc_comment`,不是 §1.3d。fixture 编码了一个错误的规则模型。
- 换成真正的孤儿 `inline.rs` 后 case 1 通过且归因正确,但 case 2/3 仍 BLOCK —— 触发的是 `verify_doc_comment_format`(`lib.rs` / `inline.rs` 缺 doc-comment),与 §1.3d 无关。

**教训:多 verifier 的 gate,单规则 fixture 会被别的规则污染。** 修法是给 gate 加一个 env 开关只跑指定 verifier(生产路径不设,行为不变):
```python
only = {p.strip() for p in os.environ.get("STAGED_FILE_GATE_ONLY_VERIFIERS","").split(",") if p.strip()}
```
这同时是给未来每条规则写 fixture 的基础设施。

**最后必须做真实仓库反向验证**(skill §5.1:只在副本上做):在 euv 的 worktree 副本里造一个 `macros/tests/probe_orphan.rs`,gate 报:
```
- macros/tests/probe_orphan.rs: +1 new (verify_no_sibling_dirs — orphan code file beside sub-dirs §1.3d)
staged_file_gate: FAIL — commit BLOCKED
```
worktree 已 `remove --force` + `prune`,euv 工作区确认干净。

### 元教训

**"规则已写进规范"和"规则会拦人"是两个命题,中间隔着调用方注册。** 写新规则时的检查清单要加一条:grep 出所有会调用 verifier 的地方(`VERIFIERS` 字典、audit 的 CHECKS 列表、CI workflow 里的命令行),逐个确认它在里面。§7「verifier 和它的调用方一起发布」讲的是同一件事,但那次的读者是我自己,这次依然是。

## §90 verify_pub_group_order.py(§18,check 48)— pub 项必须整组排在 pub(crate)/private 之前,fixer 是稳定分区不是全排序(2026-10-07)

user 原话:「很多 pub 还是可以优化成 pub crate,而且尤其是常量。注意 pub crate 定义的位置在 pub api 位置之后,顺便更新到 skill 和 hook」。

### 规则形状

`const.rs` / `static.rs` 内从上到下的可见性 rank 必须**非递增**:`pub`(2) → `pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`(1) → private(0)。一条 `pub const` 插在 `pub(crate) const` 之后 = 1 条 finding。组内顺序**不**检查 —— 存量 `(name_len, name_lex)` 排序约定继续只对新增 insert 生效,本规则只守组边界。

### 为什么 fixer 是稳定分区而不是排序

`fix_pub_group_order.py` 对每个文件做 `sorted(blocks, key=(-rank, original_index))` —— 组内保持原始相对顺序。试过按 (name_len, name_lex) 全排序的想法:diff 会从「组边界修正」爆炸成「全文件重排」,review 找不到真实改动,而且 (name_len, name_lex) 从来不是脚本强制项,fixer 擅自升级规则口径 = 单方面改规则。稳定分区是用户那句话的最小忠实实现。

### 解析器的三个自保护(全部被 self-test 钉死)

- **item span 用括号深度 + 字面量剥离**:`pub const X: &[u8] = &[\n1,\n];` 多行 item 必须整块移动;`pub const S: &str = "[{(}])";` 里的括号不进深度计数(`STRING_LITERAL` 先 mask)。
- **doc comment / attribute 跟随 item 移动**:prefix block = decl 正上方连续的 `///` / `#[...]` / `//` 行,空行即断开。`/// docs` 与它的 decl 被拆到不同组是移动后最常见的破相,self-test 断言「doc 与 decl 之间不得夹 pub(crate)」。
- **不干净就跳过**:声明未闭合(深度不回 0 / 缺 `;`)、item 之间夹非空非注释行、header 里有 `use`/注释以外的东西 —— 整个文件跳过,verifier/fixer 都不猜。unsafe fixture 上 `fix_file(write=True)` 必须返回 False。

### 验收记录

- `scripts/self_test_pub_group_order.py`:compliant 0 / violating 精确计数(1 + 3)/ tricky 0(括号召、pRIVATE 在 pub(crate) 后合法、attribute block)/ unsafe 跳过 / dry-run 不写盘 / --write 收敛 + 幂等 + 内容保持。
- gate 实测(scratch repo,staged violating const.rs → `verify_pub_group_order +1 new` BLOCK;换 compliant 版 → §18 静默)。注册点:`staged_file_gate.VERIFIERS["verify_pub_group_order"]`,`audit_one` 按文件名 gate,非 const.rs/static.rs 直接 []。
- 真仓首跑:euv 92 hits in 6 files(`cli/src/build/const.rs` 的 `pub(crate) PORT_ARG` 后插 `pub PORT_ARG_SHORT` 是典型),ctares 7 in 2,hyperlane 0。两位数 = 规则有牙且口径没炸(§2.1.3:几百条先怀疑脚本)。

### 调用方清单(§7 一起发布)

- `audit_rust_standards.py` CHECKS 末尾追加 → check 48(追加在尾部,不动已有编号)。
- `staged_file_gate.py` VERIFIERS 注册(同上)。
- fixer 没被 rust_pre_commit.py Phase 1 收编 —— Phase 1 那三套(fix_dep_order / strictify_tests_layout / doc_comment_audit)是钦定组合,本次只交付 verifier + fixer 两件,gate + audit 是权威层。

## §91 verify_const_visibility.py(§18 常量条款,check 49)— lib+bin 包的 src/main.rs 是外部消费者,声明点不算读者(2026-10-07)

**事故链**:ctares 首跑 fix_const_visibility 后 `cargo check` 炸 `E0425: cannot find value CARGO_TOML`。`CARGO_TOML` 声明在 crate-cli/src/manifest/const.rs,全 crate 内部使用 —— 但 crate-cli 是 lib+bin 包,`src/main.rs` 经 `use crate_cli::*` glob 消费它。lib 里收窄成 pub(crate) 后,bin 的 glob 里符号消失,bin 报 E0425(**不是** E0603 —— glob 消失 vs 显式 import 被拒,两个错误码不同)。

**两条分析器规则由此而来**:

1. **内部语料 ≠ 包内全部源码**。内部 = crate 的 src/** 减去一切独立 target:`tests/`、`examples/`、`benches/`、`src/bin/**`、以及**存在 `src/lib.rs` 时的 `src/main.rs`**(lib+bin 包)。没有 lib.rs 的纯 bin 包,main.rs 就是本体,保持内部。
2. **声明点自身永远不算读者**。常量声明所在行会把名字送进内部 ident 集,用「名字 ∈ 内部集」判内部读者会让每个声明自证消费,零任何读者的常量被误判为「有内部读者」而降成违规(实测:COMMENT_ONLY fixture 只出现在注释里,剥离注释后任何文件都没有它,却因声明点被当成内部读者)。正确判据:名字出现在**另一个**内部文件的 ident 集里。

**set-subtraction 版本还有第三个坑(已废)**:第一版用 `external = global_idents - internal[crate]`,任何常量的声明都把名字放进 internal[crate],差集恒空,全部常量被报违规(6/6 fixture 全中)。per-file 并集是唯一正确形态。

**配套事实**:unwired 桶(零任何读者)走 stderr 不走 stdout —— stdout 只承载违规,audit wrapper 按行计数时不会被 report-only 类污染(常量表 crate 如 hyperlane-constant 天然产出 6831 条 unwired,进 stdout 会淹没真实违规)。自测脚本 `scripts/self_test_const_visibility.py` 覆盖七常量分类 + lib+bin fixture;该 fixture 是**事故驱动**补的(ctares CARGO_TOML),不是先验设计 —— 跨 target 可见性规则必须带 lib+bin 与 tests/ 双 fixture。

---

## §92 verify_no_pub_in_tests.py(§18 单测条款,check 50)— tests/ 里两种 pub 是承重的,只有单文件读者才可去(2026-10-07)

**事故链**:user 指令「所有的单测都不需要 pub」。第一版 verifier 把 tests/ 内所有 column-0 `pub` 一律判违规,fixer 三仓连剥 74 处 → euv 22 errors、ctares 20 errors(hyperlane 0)。编译器证明两种 tests/ pub 是**承重的**,不是摆设:

1. **`tests/<sub>/const.rs` 的 item**:父模块 `tests/<sub>/mod.rs` 经 `use r#const::*;` glob 拿它们 —— 父从**子**模块 glob,隐私方向是自上而下的,子的 item 必须 pub 父才看得见(euv 实测 `DEFAULT_WWW_DIR` / `FORMATTED` / `UNFORMATTED` 三处 E0425)。
2. **`tests/mod.rs` 的 `pub use std::{...}` re-export**:glob import **不会**接力转发非 pub 的 use 绑定 —— `use super::*` 只拾取 pub use。剥成 `use std::{...}` 后,隔两跳的 `tests/<sub>/fn.rs` 立刻丢 `HashSet` / `PathBuf` 等 std 符号。

**修复路径**:diff 对回滚 + 错误驱动恢复(cargo check → 解析 `cannot find value X` / `X is private` → 只在 tests/ 内定位声明行补 pub → 迭代至 rc=0)。**注意盲区**:wave 在途 agent 新建的 const.rs 是 untracked,`git diff` 里不存在,基于 diff 的回滚永远漏掉它们 —— 错误驱动恢复不依赖 git,是唯一完备路径。

**收窄后的规则(narrow)**:只有「名字在本 tests/ 树其他文件零出现」的 pub item 才算摆设(`#[test] pub fn`、同文件 helper、声明后没人读的常量)。`pub use` 与被父 glob 的子模块 item 永不标。fixture 必须带四种:跨文件 const(留)、mod.rs pub use(留)、同文件 pub fn(剥)、字符串里的 "pub fn"(不报)。

**更正(同日第二轮,user 钦定「所有单测 tests 目录下的禁止出现 pub use」后实测)**:上面第 2 条判错了。`use`(无 pub 前缀)的 re-export 绑定**可以**沿祖先 glob 链传到子孙模块 —— euv-cli tests/mod.rs 的 `use std::{...}`(无 pub)经两跳 `use super::*;` 到 fn.rs 编译全过。Rust 语义:子孙模块对祖先的私有项(含 use 绑定)可见,glob 拾取可见绑定。真正承重的只有第 1 条(父从子模块 glob,方向反了)。**新规则由此落地**:tests/ 内 `pub use` / `pub(crate) use` / `pub(super) use` 一律禁止,全部改纯 `use`,三仓(euv 5 / hyperlane 4 / ctares 5 处)改完 `--all-targets` 0 error。verify_no_pub_in_tests.py 已把 pub-marked use 列为独立违规类。

**配套事实**:lib+bin 包(euv-cli)的 112 个 pub const 全部收窄后,编译器一轮点名回退 112/112 —— cli 的常量 pub 面被 tests/ + main.rs 完全消费,机械规则 0 可收。这类「测试驱动 pub 面」要收窄只能改测试(断言行为而非 const 表)或挪成 src 内 #[cfg(test)] 单测,是 user 级决策,不是脚本决策。

## §93 常量绝对禁令的落地陷阱(depub 内联污染 + rustc 坐标驱动修复法,2026-10-07)

**背景**:user 两轮裁决「常量是肯定不需要pub的」+「单测里常量不需要验证」。euv 全量落地:157 个常量去 pub(131 小值内联进 tests、24 大值逐字内联、2 零读者删除)+ 常量验证类测试整套删除(global_css/css_consts/fmt_consts 目录、cli_api 常量表 4 测试)。过程炸出 435+ 编译错误,教训如下。

**教训 1:对 tests 做常量值内联,禁用裸正则/逐行 blank 的字符串扫描。** 多行字符串字面量必须**整文件**计算 span(逐行 blank 会把多行串中间的代码行当代码),且替换必须用**词边界**(`\bNAME\b`)—— 否则 `web` 之类的短值名会把 `web_sys`、assert 消息文本、JS fixture 内容全部污染(9366 处误伤的教训)。正确做法:整文件读入 → STRING_RE/CHAR_RE 对全文本 blank 出 span → span 外才做 `\bNAME\b` 替换。

**教训 2:修复轮同样必须 span-aware,且最可靠的定位器是 rustc 自己。** 加引号/解引号的批量修复若不带字符串 span,会在串内制造新的嵌套引号破坏(`"{ a, b }"` → `"{ "a", "b" }"`)。收敛最快的闭环:**跑 `cargo check --message-format=short`,按错误码分类,用 rustc 给的 file:line:col 逐点修那一个词**:E0425(裸值名)→ 该坐标加引号;E0423(expected value found struct/macro X)→ 该坐标的裸 X 加引号;E0308/E0277 found `&str` → 该坐标解引号;expected `&str` found integer → 该坐标加引号。每轮修完重跑,直至清零。**禁止无坐标的全局正则修复**(一次 `"(\w+)" =>` 模式替换把合法字符串字面量 match 臂改成绑定模式 = 静默语义损坏,编译抓不到,只有 cargo test 能抓)。

**教训 3:cargo test 是语义修复的必须门禁,编译绿 ≠ 修复完。** 静默损坏类别:被引号化的变量绑定(`assert_eq!("value", 42)`)、被解引号的字符串字面量(`Some("value") => "value"` 震荡)、`"lit" =>` 变绑定臂。它们的共同特征:编译全过,测试才红。修复流程固定为 check 0 → clippy 0 → test 全绿才算完。

**教训 4:depub 后必须扫 glob reexport 断裂。** 常量降 `pub(crate)` 后,各 mod.rs 里 `pub use {r#const::*, ...}` 报 "glob import doesn't reexport anything with visibility pub"(warning 级)。修法:拆成 `pub use {r#fn::*, ...};` + 空行 + `pub(crate) use r#const::*;` 两组(**必须空行分隔,否则 cargo fmt 把 pub(crate) 行排到 pub 行前面,又触发 §6.1 组序 FAIL**)。

**教训 5:跨 crate 同名 const 是 depub 扫描器的固定假阳性。** macros/core/docs 各自有 `pub(crate) const STR_HYPHEN` 等本地副本,名字 token 匹配会把它们记成 cli 常量的"跨 crate 读者"。manual-cross-src 清单落地前必须先 grep 消费方是否已有同名本地 decl —— euv 实测 20 项里大半是假阳性,真跨 crate 的只有 engine 数学常量/example、THEME_DARK/docs+example、EUV_MD_CSS/docs、ENV_OUT_DIR/docs build.rs 四项。

**教训 6:example 等下游消费数学常量,迁移目标是 std 不是本地副本。** engine 的 PI/TWO_PI/HALF_PI 本就是 std 重导出(facade),按反 facade 原则直接删,下游 mod.rs 根部 `use std::f64::consts::{FRAC_PI_2, PI};` 沿 glob 链下放(§92);EPSILON=1e-6 是 engine 语义值不是 std 值,消费方各持 mirror const(写注释 `// Mirrors the engine's math EPSILON`)。同名 const 别放进会被祖先 glob 聚合的位置(page/mod.rs `pub(crate) use {game_3d::*, raytrace::*}` 会让两个同名 HALF_PI 对 fn.rs 歧义 E0659)—— 消歧优先改用 std 名(FRAC_PI_2)而不是加本地别名。


## §94 verify_no_toml_mod_comments.py(§2.5 绝对化,check 51)— TOML 进 gate 的四个落地坑(2026-10-09)

**背景**:user directive「toml文件和mod.rs禁止注释」。旧执行面:check 5 只扫 diff 且正则 `^\s*//[^/!]` 只捕 `//`(SKILL.md 文字声称捕 `///`,实测 `[^/!]` 把 `///` 也排除了,文档与脚本不一致);TOML 零覆盖;check 26 的 mod.rs 注释分支豁免第 1 行 `///`。落地后四个坑:

1. **名字过滤会静默清空 verifier**。第一版 `find ... -not -path "*/tmp/*"` + `SKIP_PARTS={"tmp"}` 想跳过 crate-cli 的 scratch crate,结果**任何** checkout 在含 `tmp` 组件路径下的仓库(/tmp 本身、~/code/tmp-*)全部 0 命中 —— fixture 进 /tmp 跑 audit e2e 时 violating 侧 check 51 PASS。修法:scratch 目录交给 `_drop_git_ignored`(crate-cli/tmp 本来就 git-ignored),机制不靠名字。**每接一个 tree-wide verifier,必须先在 /tmp 下的 git fixture 上跑一次 audit 端到端双向** —— 单测 audit_one 走 /var/folders 永远发现不了。
2. **TOML 进 gate 必须按原扩展名物化 baseline**。`staged_file_gate` 旧实现把所有 baseline 写成 `X.head-baseline.rs`:TOML baseline 会被 verify_no_panicking_option_getter 这类全仓 `rglob("*.rs")` 的 verifier 当 Rust 扫,且 scope 判断(`path.suffix != ".rs"` 系)在 baseline 上恒空 = 历史债全算新增。修法:`_suffix_for(target)`,TOML baseline 物化为 `.head-baseline.toml`;verifier 的 `scope_of` 先剥两种 baseline 后缀再判 scope。
3. **单行 TOML 字符串未闭合时,跨行后的 `#` 要照报**。basic/literal 字符串按 TOML spec 不能跨行;扫描器在 `\n` 处把 unterminated 单行串状态复位为 normal(多行 `"""`/`'''` 不受影响)。「宁假阳性不漏报」:坏 TOML 里的注释藏起来比报出来糟。
4. **rust_pre_commit.py 的 `--files` 替换是单个空格拼接 argv 元素(潜伏 bug,同轮修)**。`"{toml_files}"` 被替换成 `"a b"` 一个 argv 元素,所有 fixer 的 `nargs="*"` 把它解析成一个不存在的复合路径 —— **scope ≥ 2 个文件时 Phase 1 全部静默 no-op**(单文件碰巧正常)。修法:placeholder 处 splice 真实 argv 列表(`argv_template[i:i+1] = values`);新 fixer 自己的 `--files` 再按 whitespace split 兜底。

**check 26 对齐**:`verify_module_imports_centralized.py` 的 mod.rs 注释分支已删除(注释统一归 check 51),配套 self_test_no_module_imports_centralized.py 两处断言改成「注释不归本 check」。

## §95 fix_dep_order.py 吞掉跨段空行的回归(§74 修复实际失效,2026-10-09)

**事故**:euv 根 Cargo.toml 删 2 行注释后顺手跑 `fix_dep_order.py --write`(hyperlane entry 归位触发 block 重序列化),结果 `[workspace.dependencies]` 最后一个 entry(多行 web-sys)与 `[dependencies]` 之间的空行被吃掉,verify_dep_order 立刻报 §13.7.2a「expected exactly 1 blank line; got no blank line」。**三函数契约断裂位置在 sort 不在 serialize**:§74 修的是 `serialize_block` 让 last entry 也 honour `followed_by_blank`,但 `sort_block_items` 把**全部** input flag 当噪声丢弃,只重设 local/third 组边界那一条 —— last entry 的 flag 永远到不了 serialize,§74 的修复形同虚设。教训:三函数契约(parse → sort → serialize)的任何一环「丢 flag 再重建」时,必须枚举**所有**承重 flag,不只是当前 bug 报告里点名的那一个。**修法**:`plan_changes` 在 sort 之后按「块后是否还有下一个 section」(`sp[1] < len(text)`)重设 `expected[-1].followed_by_blank` —— 边界 flag 的权威来源是 span 几何,不是源文件 whitespace。验证:synthetic repro(乱序 block + 多行 last entry + 后继 section)rewrite 后空行存活 + verify 0 + 二次 fix "Nothing to do";hyperlane/ctares 无 phantom rewrite(Comparator 对 trailing blank 本来就容忍,决策不变)。

## §96 verify_lib_rs_order.py 属性行吃掉空行(§6.1 空行规则 vs rustfmt 不可兼得,2026-10-09)

**事故**:euv `ui/tests/wasm_fallback/mod.rs` 与 `engine/tests/wasm_fallback/mod.rs` 被 check 27 报「`mod` group and `private` group touch without a blank line」,实际文件在 `mod r#fn;` 与 `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")] use super::*;` 之间**有**空行。根因:verifier 把 `#[cfg]` 属性行当「非 decl 代码行」处理,统一 `blank_before = False`,把属性上方那个空行作废。按 verifier 的唯一合规写法(空行挪到属性与 use 之间)rustfmt `--check` 必挂 —— **rustfmt 不允许属性与被装饰项之间有空行**,两个工具不可能同时满足。**修法**:属性行(`#` 开头)不再重置 `blank_before`,只透传 —— 属性属于**下一个** decl,空行归属权在属性上方。非属性非 decl 行保持原行为(代码行粘连仍是违规)。验证:无空行的 `mod` + `#[cfg]` + `use` 仍报违规(属性透传 False),有空行版本通过;`self_test_no_lib_rs_order.py` fixtures + 6 mutations 全 PASS。**教训:空行类规则遇到属性行,先想清楚属性归属于上一行还是下一行 —— Rust 的外层属性恒属下一行。**

## §97 verify_no_qualified_std_path.py / fix_no_qualified_std_path.py(R6.3 std 收编,check 47)— 203-hit 清扫的八个落地坑(2026-10-09)

1. **字符字面量正则必须恰好一个字符**:`'(?:\\.|[^'\\])'`。写成 `*` 时,lifetime `'a`/`'_` 的撇号会和同一行(或跨行)下一个引号误配成"字符串",把中间的真代码吞进 blanking —— ctares 实测 27/203 hits 因此静默消失(verifier 逐行扫、fixer 整文件扫,两套行为还会互相不一致)。established scripts(depub_consts / verify_no_impl_trait_params / verify_no_pub_in_tests / verify_no_redundant_accessor_attr)一直都是恰好一字符,新脚本抄它们,别自己造。
2. **raw string 必须 backreference 配对**:`b?r(#*)".*?"\1`。写成 `r?#*"..."#*` 时 `r#"{"a":1}"#` 在第一个内嵌 `"` 处提前闭合,后续引号连锁误配,跨行吞掉真实代码(crate-cli/tests/bump/fn.rs 的 JSON fixture 后方 3 个 hit 就是这么丢的)。
3. **blanking 必须保换行**:`re.sub(r"[^\n]", " ", m.group(0))`。直接 `" " * len(...)` 会把多行字符串里的 `\n` 压平,之后 `zip(text.splitlines(), blanked.splitlines())` 行对齐整个漂移,替换 offset 前移 N 字符 —— 产出 `Errortent` 这类把前一行代码吃掉的**静默语义破坏**(cargo check 只能抓住语法层面的,语义层面要靠「HEAD 副本跑修正版 fixer 再与工作树 diff -rq」对拍兜底)。
4. **`macro_rules!` / `quote!` / `quote_spanned!` body 是豁免类**:宏体内 token 在**下游 crate** 展开时求值,定义仓 root 的 import 永远到不了展开点 —— 把 `std::sync::Arc::new($val)` 改成 bare `Arc` 会直接破坏宏 API(std-macro-extensions 20 个 macro.rs、lombok-macros 的 quote! 全是这类,改写后全部回退)。与字符串字面量同属"emitted, not consumed"。注意 `macro_rules!` 和分隔符之间有名字:正则要 `macro_rules!\s*\w+\s*[({\[]`。
5. **同名 leaf 冲突的降级规则**:同一 root 需要两个同 leaf 路径时(典型:`std::error::Error` trait vs 既有 `std::io::Error` struct),字典序小者留 bare(`use std::error::Error;`),大者降命名空间形式(root `use std::io;` + 现场 `io::Error`);`std::thread::Result` 撞 prelude `Result` 永远降级(`use std::thread;` + `thread::Result`)。**既有嵌套 brace import(`use std::{io::Error, ...}`)单行 dedup 正则看不见** —— E0252/E0404 全靠 `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` 坐标驱动修(§93 教训 2 同一 loop)。
6. **glob 链断裂时 §6.1 仍是唯一答案**:tcplane `utils/thread/fn.rs` 收不到 lib.rs 的 import,因为 `utils/mod.rs` 和 `utils/thread/mod.rs` 没有 `use super::*;`,且 fn.rs 自己也缺。**正解不是把 import 塞到子 mod.rs**(那触发 check 28 双报:§6.1 子 mod.rs 不得直接 import std + §6.2 mod.rs 里 use 必须 pub use),而是补齐链条:lib.rs 持 import,两级 mod.rs 各补 `use super::*;`,fn.rs 补 `use super::*;`。
7. **fixer 部分应用不可自愈**:sub-file rewrite 全落盘、root import 按序写入的架构下,中途崩溃 = 已改写的现场等不到 import,而重跑时 verifier 已报 0 hits → 不再生成 plan → 永不修复。恢复路径只有 rustc 坐标 loop(编译错误列出全部缺 import 的 bare name,按 crate 补齐再编译)。教训:root import 应先于 sub-file rewrite 落盘,或 plan 可重入。
8. **R6.3 清扫的连锁反应**:root 追加单行 `use std::...;` 会立刻触发 check 43(§6.6 同根聚合,实测 17 个 root)→ 聚合成单条 brace form;签名从 `std::error::Error` 变 bare 后 doc `# Returns` 字面量失配触发 check 37(§2.2 Layer 4,实测 6+3 处)→ doc 同步改。**清扫类 fixer 的完工定义永远是被牵连 check 全部归零,不是目标 check 单独归零。**

## §98 doc_comment_audit.py 会往 tests/ 树写 doc 注释,与 §14.5 对打(2026-10-09 实测)

1. **症状**: `rust_pre_commit.py` 在 tests/ 内有改动的仓上永远 loop 不收敛 —— Phase 1 的 `doc_comment_audit.py` 给 tests/ 内的 helper fn(无 `#[test]` 属性的自由函数,如 `start_server_with`)和 `#[test]` fn 体内的嵌套 fn 补写 `/// Body of the ...` doc 块;Phase 2 的 check 28(`verify_no_test_comments.py`,§14.5 tests/ 零注释)立刻把它们全报出来;下一轮 Phase 1 又写回去。3 轮迭代后 FAIL 出局。实测 hyperlane 仓 `core/tests/server/fn.rs` 被注入 19 处违规。
2. **根因**: fixer 的豁免逻辑 `_scan_test_regions` 只跳过 `#[cfg(test)]` mod 块和紧跟 `#[test]`/`#[tokio::test]` 属性的 fn,**不按路径豁免 tests/ 目录**;而 verifier 侧(`verify_doc_comment_format.py` / `verify_no_test_comments.py`)对整个 tests/ 树免疫。fixer 制造 verifier 必报的违规 = 三函数契约撕裂的变体(§73-75 同类)。
3. **临时绕行**: 任务 diff 触及 tests/ 时用 `rust_pre_commit.py --no-fix`(跳过全部 Phase 1 fixer),并在提交前 `git restore --worktree <被污染的 tests 文件>` 把 fixer 写入的 doc 块退掉 —— staged 版本不受污染,commit hook(`staged_file_gate.py` 不跑 fixer)能正常过。
4. **修复方向(未做)**: `doc_comment_audit.py` 应在文件发现阶段就排除 `**/tests/**`,与 `verify_doc_comment_format.py` 的 tests/ 豁免对齐。修之前任何触及 tests/ 的改动都走上面的绕行路径。
5. **关联发现(版本 bump 触发 §13.7 重排)**: dep entry 的排序键含 entry 全文字符数,所以 `hyperlane = "21.7.8"` → `"21.12.0"` 这种纯版本号改动会改变排序键,要求 entry 在 dep 块内移位(hyperlane-quick-start playground 实测 2 处)。**修法不是手排,是跑 `fix_dep_order.py --write`** —— 它按 verifier 同一套 parser 重排,跑完 verify_dep_order 归零。

## §98 verify_const_visibility.py 常量表 crate 配置豁免(rust-standards.toml,check 49 首个配置字段,2026-10-09)

**裁决**:http-constant 这类「整个 crate 的公开 API 就是常量本身」的常量表 crate 不适用 §18 绝对禁令 —— 但豁免**不写死在 verifier 里**,走仓根 `rust-standards.toml` 的 `pub_const_exempt = ["http-constant"]`(字符串数组,元素是 `[package].name` 标识,不是目录名 —— constant/ 目录的包名是 http-constant)。这是 rust-standards 工具链的第一个仓级配置文件,立下的先例:(1) 字段级配置用平铺 key = string-array,不加注释(§2.5 对一切 TOML 生效,包括自己的配置文件);(2) 本机 python3 无 tomllib(Xcode 自带 < 3.11),平铺字段用定向 regex 解析即可,别为这一个字段引依赖;(3) 豁免只影响 **owning 侧**(被列 crate 自身常量不报,violation/unwired 双桶都跳),reader 侧保留 —— 别的 crate 的常量读者语料照算;(4) main() 把豁免名单打 stderr,audit 只数 stdout 行不受影响,且豁免不静默;(5) `audit_one`(staged_file_gate)与 fixer 共用 `analyze()`,豁免自动覆盖 gate 与 depub 工具,不需要第二处注册。**连带效果**:大池子(2114 hits)豁免后露出 3 条真违规(compress 的 CONTENT_ENCODING/EMPTY_STR、request 的 APP_NAME),其"外部读者"全是与 http_constant 同名的保守计数,depub 后 cargo check 全绿;depub 若让一个 `pub use r#const::*` glob 不再转出任何 pub 项,clippy `unused_imports` 会报 —— 改 `pub(crate) use`(§6.2 的 crate 内部分发形式),不要删 glob 让链断掉。
