Verify rust-standards §5.2 (new, 2026-09-26 third iteration):
closure parameters MUST have explicit type annotations.

User original (2026-09-26 third iteration):
  "闭包参数需要显示标注"

Specifically:

  ❌  let f = |x, y| x + y;
  ❌  vec.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect()
  ❌  .filter(|item| item.is_valid())

  ✅  let f = |x: u32, y: u32| -> u32 { x + y };
  ✅  vec.iter().map(|x: &u32| x * 2).collect()
  ✅  .filter(|item: &Item| item.is_valid())

Exemptions (legitimate cases):
  - `||` (empty parameter list) — no params, no annotation needed
  - `|..|` (rest pattern) — no name, no annotation possible
  - `|(a, b): &(T, U)|` — pattern destructuring WITH type annotation
    on the whole tuple (this IS an explicit annotation)
  - `|&x: &T|` — single ref pattern with type annotation
  - inside `tests/` directory (R14.7 self-contained)

Detection approach:
  - Find all `|<params>|` patterns in the source.
  - For each, parse comma-separated params.
  - Each param is either:
    * `_` or `_name` — needs `: T` suffix
    * `name` (bare identifier) — needs `: T` suffix
    * `name: T` — ok
    * `(pat): T` — tuple pattern with type — ok
    * `&name: T` or `&mut name: T` — ref with type — ok
    * `..` — rest pattern — ok
  - Report any param that is just a bare identifier or `_name`
    without `: T`.

This script is heuristic — it cannot understand every valid
closure pattern (closures that destructure complex nested
patterns might false-positive).  When in doubt, prefer
false-negative (miss) over false-positive (false flag).  When
implementing new code, prefer explicit type annotation per
project convention.

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any violation.

# Find closures.  Tricky because:
#   - `||` (no params) — must not match
#   - `| x |` (single param) — must match
#   - `|x: u32, y: String|` (multiple typed) — must match
#   - `|(a, b): &(T, U)|` (tuple pattern with type) — must match
#   - `|..|` (rest only) — must not flag
#   - `|x: &Foo|` (single typed) — must match
#   - `|x|` — violation
#
# Strategy: regex that captures |<params>|, then we parse the
# captured params in Python (not regex backrefs) for robustness.
#
# We also need to avoid:
#   - bitwise OR in expressions (e.g. `a | b`) — outside closures
#   - `||` operator (e.g. `a || b`) — single `|`, not `|...|`
#   - generics like `Vec<u32>` — `<u32>` not confused with `|`
#
# Heuristic: look for `|<non-empty-content>|` where content does
# not start with `=` or `|` (so `||` operator excluded).  Then
# split content by `,` at top-level (no `<>` nesting counted
# here — but Rust closures rarely have generic params inside).
