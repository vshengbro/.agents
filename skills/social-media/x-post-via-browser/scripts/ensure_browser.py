"""Make sure a usable x.com tab exists, starting what is missing.

Three states, three actions, and nothing more:

  browser down          launch it through the real-profile launcher
  up but no x.com tab   open ONE tab at the composer
  up with an x.com tab  do nothing at all

The launcher is chrome-real-profile-launch/scripts/run.sh, not a raw
`Google Chrome --remote-debugging-port`, because the copy of the profile is
what carries the login. --no-tab is passed to it so the launcher does not open
a page of its own; this script decides what the one tab shows.

Opening a tab is a page load, and a page load makes the user confirm it in
their UI. That is why this is a separate script with a single narrow job and
the commit gate exempts only THIS FILE: every other script in the skill stays
forbidden from loading a page, so "the publisher opened a tab" remains a
defect rather than a shortcut.
